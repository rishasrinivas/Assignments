# Machine Learning Pipeline Report

## 1. Pipeline Overview
This report summarizes the results of the machine learning pipeline for bioinformatics. The pipeline consists of three main stages:
1.  **Data Preparation (PREPARE):** Raw data is processed, features are selected, and data is split into training and testing sets.
2.  **Model Training (TRAIN):** A RandomForestClassifier model is trained and tuned using GridSearchCV.
3.  **Model Evaluation (EVAL):** The trained model is evaluated on a test set, and performance metrics are calculated.
