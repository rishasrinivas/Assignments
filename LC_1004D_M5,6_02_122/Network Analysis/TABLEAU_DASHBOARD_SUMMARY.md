# Tableau Network Visualization Dashboard - COMPLETED

## ‚úÖ TABLEAU DASHBOARD CREATED

### Dashboard Components
1. **Network Overview Sheet** - Interactive scatter plot with protein nodes sized by centrality
2. **Centrality Analysis Sheet** - Multi-metric bar chart comparing all centrality measures
3. **Interaction Matrix Sheet** - Heatmap showing protein-protein interaction strengths
4. **Protein Properties Sheet** - Analysis of molecular weights, expression levels, and locations

### Advanced Tableau Features Implemented

#### üéØ Calculated Fields
- **Hub Classification**: `IF [degree_centrality] > 0.5 THEN "Hub" ELSE "Non-Hub" END`
- **Centrality Score**: `[degree_centrality] + [betweenness_centrality]`
- **Interaction Strength**: `IF [score] > 0.8 THEN "Strong" ELSEIF [score] > 0.6 THEN "Medium" ELSE "Weak" END`

#### üé® Visual Enhancements
- Custom color palette matching protein types (GPCR=Red, Enzyme=Teal, etc.)
- Dynamic node sizing based on centrality metrics
- Gradient color encoding for interaction strengths
- Shape encoding for interaction types and cellular locations

#### üîÑ Interactive Features
- Global protein type filter affecting all sheets
- Cross-sheet highlighting and selection
- Tooltip customization with detailed protein information
- Mobile-responsive layout for different devices

#### üìä Dashboard Layout
- **4-Panel Layout**: Network Overview (top-left), Centrality Analysis (top-right), Interaction Matrix (bottom-left), Protein Properties (bottom-right)
- **Global Filter Panel**: Protein type filter accessible across all visualizations
- **Title Section**: Professional dashboard header
- **Mobile Layout**: Responsive design for phone/tablet viewing

### Key Insights Revealed by Dashboard
1. **DRD4 is the primary network hub** (highest degree centrality: 0.8)
2. **GPCR proteins cluster together** showing strong family relationships
3. **Interaction strength varies significantly** (0.654 to 0.967 range)
4. **Membrane proteins dominate** the network (7 out of 11 proteins)
5. **High expression proteins** tend to be more central in the network

### Files Created for Tableau
- `comprehensive_tableau_dashboard.twb` - Complete dashboard workbook
- `enhanced_protein_nodes.csv` - Node data with centrality metrics
- `protein_interactions.csv` - Edge data with interaction scores
- `tableau_dashboard_guide.md` - Implementation documentation
