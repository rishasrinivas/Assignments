- Bar charts showing different centrality measures
- Comparative analysis of protein importance
- Highlighting key network hubs

### 3. Interaction Strength Matrix
- Heatmap of protein-protein interactions
- Interaction confidence scores
- Pathway relationship mapping

### 4. Protein Properties Dashboard

## Data Connections
- Primary: enhanced_protein_nodes.csv
- Secondary: protein_interactions.csv
- Relationship: protein_id field linking

## Calculated Fields Created
1. Centrality Score = [Degree Centrality] + [Betweenness Centrality]
2. Hub Classification = IF [Degree Centrality] > 0.5 THEN "Hub" ELSE "Non-Hub" END
3. Interaction Strength Category = IF [Score] > 0.8 THEN "Strong" ELSEIF [Score] > 0.6 THEN "Medium" ELSE "Weak" END

## Dashboard Insights
- DRD4 identified as primary network hub
- Strong clustering of dopamine receptors
- COMT serves as metabolic bridge
- G-protein coupling critical for signaling
