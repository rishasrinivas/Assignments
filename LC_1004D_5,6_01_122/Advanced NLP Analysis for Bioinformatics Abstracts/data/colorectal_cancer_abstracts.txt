BACKGROUND: The multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test is a growing and 
convenient option for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Adherence to screening 
is critical to optimize patient outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate 
real-world adherence to mt-sDNA testing and the rate of follow-up colonoscopy 
after positive results among average-risk patients within a large regional 
health system.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 45-75 years in 
the Hartford HealthCare system whose provider ordered an mt-sDNA test between 
August 2014 and May 2023. Those at high risk of CRC were excluded. Adherence was 
defined as the return of a successfully completed test with valid results within 
365 days of shipment. Rates of and time to follow-up colonoscopy were assessed 
in mt-sDNA-positive patients. Logistic regression assessed characteristics 
associated with adherence.
RESULTS: Of 24,945 included patients, 96.8% had never previously taken an 
mt-sDNA test and 60.5% were female. Overall, 17,240 patients (69.1%) adhered to 
the mt-sDNA test. Younger adults aged 45-49 years had high adherence (74.0%). 
Logistic regression found age 45-49 years, income > $75K, history of mt-sDNA 
adherence, and seeing a gastrointestinal specialist were predictors of greater 
adherence. Of 2,468 patients (14.3%) with positive test results, 1,686 (68.3%) 
had follow-up colonoscopies within a year, and 1,322 (53.6%) within 4 months, of 
the test result.
CONCLUSIONS: In this regional health system, nearly 70% of patients adhered to 
mt-sDNA testing. Among those with positive results, 68.3% completed follow-up 
colonoscopies. These findings highlight the potential utility of mt-sDNA testing 
in supporting CRC screening and follow-up in certain clinical settings.
IMPACT: mt-sDNA testing may support improved CRC screening adherence and timely 
follow-up in certain health care settings.

BACKGROUND: Cancer metastasis, primarily driven by epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), is responsible for most cancer-related mortalities. 
Traditional pre-clinical models fail to fully capture mesenchymal 
characteristics due to the loss of human stroma. The extracellular matrix (ECM) 
plays a crucial role in EMT, yet conventional in vitro models often rely on 
defined ECM components, which may not adequately replicate the human 
physiological ECM niche.
METHODS: To mimic the in situ dissemination of cancer cells, we employed a 
patient-derived extracellular matrix (pdECM). We transitioned the culture matrix 
for patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids from a basement membrane extract 
(BME) to a patient-derived ECM (pdECM). We performed single-cell multiomic 
analyses, integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic data, to investigate changes 
in organoid phenotypes and reconstruct the EMT trajectory.
RESULTS: Organoids cultured in the pdECM exhibited increased tumor cell 
dissemination and motility, resembling in situ lesions without exogenous ligand 
treatment. Single-cell multiomic analysis revealed TNF-α signaling as an early 
metastatic event in the EMT trajectory. Epigenomic changes led to increased 
accessibility of AP-1 complex target genes, particularly MMP7, which promoted an 
invasive phenotype. Our multimodal computational approach distinguished early 
and late EMT states, demonstrating that pdECM-induced EMT occurs independently 
of traditional EMT master regulators. Notably, pdECM organoids exhibited a 
partial EMT phenotype, characterized by hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal states.
CONCLUSION: This study presents an advanced in vitro model that closely 
recapitulates in situ tumorigenesis and provides novel insights into the 
metastatic cascade. The pdECM system enables the reconstruction of EMT dynamics, 
highlighting the critical role of ECM composition in metastasis and offering a 
physiologically relevant platform for the development of targeted therapies.

This is an investigator-initiated, open-label, single-arm, phase II trial that 
aimed to assess the combination of sintilimab plus anlotinib among patients with 
treatment-naïve metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) (APICAL-CRC 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04271813). Between June 2020 and September 2023, a 
total of 30 patients were eventually enrolled and received the study regimen. 
Among these 30 patients, 50% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) 
score of 0-1, and the other 50% had a score of 2. The objective response rates 
(ORRs) were 48.3% (95% CI 29.4-67.5) in the efficacy-evaluable cohort and 46.7% 
(95% CI 28.3-65.7) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) cohort. Twelve patients had 
stable disease, and the disease control rates (DCRs) were 89.7% (95% CI 
72.6-97.8) and 86.7% (95% CI 69.3-96.2) in the efficacy-evaluable and ITT 
cohorts, respectively. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 8.6 
months (95% CI 4.8-11.0), and the median overall survival (mOS) reached 22.9 
months (95% CI 13.5-36.3). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade 
were reported in 23 patients (76.7%), and grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 4 patients 
(13.3%). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of 
liver metastases was an independent prognostic factor for poor PFS (HR = 5.66, 
95% CI 1.58-20.2) and OS (HR = 7.85, 95% CI 1.38-44.8), whereas FLT mutation was 
independently associated with poor OS(HR = 12.5, 95% CI 1.54-101). This trial 
demonstrated that sintilimab plus anlotinib exhibited promising antitumor 
efficacy along with a manageable safety profile among treatment-naïve mCRC 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Distant metastasis and immune evasion are the major obstacles for 
successful colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. The link between metastasis and 
immune evasion, as well as their therapeutic significance, remains unclear.
METHODS: Long non-coding RNAs from six paired CRC and normal tissues were 
screened by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). LncRNA-CTD (CTD-2568A17.8) expression 
levels were determined using in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR 
analysis. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to confirm the function of 
lncRNA-CTD. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the impact of lncRNA-CTD on 
immune cell infiltration and T-cell function. RNA-seq combined with RNA 
pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation assay was used to identify the changes in 
downstream molecules induced by lncRNA-CTD. The therapeutic value of the 
combination of lncRNA-CTD and immune checkpoint inhibitors has been evaluated.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a novel long non-coding RNA, lncRNA-CTD, 
which is downregulated in CRC and correlates with both metastasis and 
immunotherapy response. Mechanistically, the interaction of lncRNA and smad2 
prevented the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of smad2, which 
inhibited the expression of snail1, thereby inhibiting the metastasis of CRC. 
LncRNA-CTD enhances major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression 
on the cancer cell membrane by interacting with STUB1 to disrupt the interaction 
of STUB1 with the MHC-I activator NLRC5 and subsequent NLRC5 
ubiquitination-mediated degradation, increasing the susceptibility of CRC cells 
to being killed by CD8+ T cells. TFAP4 overexpression in CRC cells caused 
lncRNA-CTD downregulation. Moreover, the combination of lncRNA-CTD gene delivery 
therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors exerted an additive effect on tumor 
growth inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study reveals the role and mechanism of 
lncRNA-CTD in CRC metastasis and immune evasion. Overexpression of lncRNA-CTD 
suppresses CRC metastasis and improves the efficacy of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors.Cite Now.

Background Patients with symptoms of suspected cancer usually present to general 
practice, however they may present to other healthcare providers, such as 
community pharmacies. The clinical role of pharmacy staff has significantly 
increased in England in the recent years. Aim To describe the range of 
interventions targeting early cancer detection in community pharmacies globally; 
to summarise the outcomes of these interventions; to report on barriers and 
facilitators to delivering the interventions and on service users' and 
stakeholders' experiences with such interventions. Design and Setting Systematic 
review with narrative synthesis. Method Online searches of Medline, CINAHL, 
Cochrane CENTRAL, PsychInfo and EMBASE and UK-based relevant grey literature 
were performed. Interventions were defined as any intervention, initiative or 
programme that focused on community pharmacy-based early cancer detection 
programmes. Results 14134 titles and abstracts were screened, and 330 full text 
publications were reviewed by two independent reviewers. 52 publications were 
included in the review and reported on interventions targeting early diagnosis 
of colorectal (n=19), skin (n=8), lung (n=4), cervical (n=3), breast (n=2), head 
and neck (n=2), and mixed (n=14) cancers. The feasibility and acceptability of 
such interventions by community pharmacy staff, customers and patients have been 
demonstrated in the included studies. Studies involving opportunistic 
identification of customers with suspected cancer symptoms in pharmacies 
recruited only a few participants. Conclusion Robust, large scale clinical 
trials are needed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness, delineate and inform the 
use of relevant clinical outcomes, and to explore arrangements for information 
sharing between community pharmacy and other healthcare settings.

BACKGROUND: Employing a panel of biomarkers may enable the early diagnosis of 
colorectal cancer. Among these biomarkers, long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) and 
microRNAs (miRNAs) are significant due to their crucial roles in biological and 
metabolic processes.
AIMS: Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the diagnostic 
value of the biomarkers LncRNA-xloc-000303, lncRNA-LOC152578, and miR-29a in the 
pre-treatment stage of colorectal cancer in Iranian patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 30 tumor tissue samples and 30 adjacent 
healthy tissue samples were collected, and RNA was extracted using the Trizol 
kit. Subsequently, the relative expression of the candidate microRNA and LncRNAs 
was analyzed using real-time PCR. The obtained gene expression data were then 
analyzed using REST software.
RESULTS: In this study, it was found that the expression of LncRNA-xloc-000303 
in tumor tissues significantly increased compared to healthy tissue (p < 0.001). 
Additionally, the analysis revealed that the expression level of 
lncRNA-LOC152578 showed an increase in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues 
(p = 0.57), although these changes were not statistically significant. The 
results of the hsa-miR-29a expression analysis indicated a down regulation in 
tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues; however, this change was also not 
statistically significant (p = 0.34).
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the expression changes of 
LncRNA-xloc-000303 in cancer tissue were significant compared to adjacent 
healthy tissue, suggesting its potential use as a biomarker for diagnosing 
colorectal cancer. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the biomarker 
specificity of lncRNA-LOC152578 and hsa-miR-29a. This study was conducted in an 
Iranian population and its results can be used in the future for personalized 
medicine in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.

Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a Gram-negative bacterium present in 
the oral cavity, is one of the primary pathogens associated with periodontitis. 
P. gingivalis has also been linked to other non-oral pathologies, such as 
diabetes, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. The P2X7 receptor 
plays a role in resolving oral infection with P. gingivalis, and, separately, is 
associated with increased damage in colitis. This study investigated whether 
ingestion of P. gingivalis could aggravate colitis and whether the P2X7 receptor 
could play a role in this effect. Wild-type (WT) and P2X7-deficient mice were 
orally inoculated by gavage with P. gingivalis, and colitis was induced by 
intrarectal injection with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). P. 
gingivalis ingestion upregulated P2X7 receptor immunoreactivity in the colon of 
WT mice. P. gingivalis also triggered intestinal inflammation and reduced the 
colon length in WT mice but not P2X7-deficient mice. The balance of regulatory T 
(Treg) cells and Th17 cells of the mesenteric lymph node was perturbed in WT 
mice that had been administered P. gingivalis and TNBS, while this was not 
observed in P2X7-deficient mice. Th17 cells were increased in WT mice in 
response to P. gingivalis, while P2X7-deficient mice showed an increase in Treg 
cells. P. gingivalis ingestion induced liver injury in WT mice, but not in 
P2X7-deficient mice. Furthermore, the liver from WT mice that had been 
administered P. gingivalis and TNBS showed higher levels of bacteria than 
P2X7-deficient mice. Our findings suggest that the P2X7 receptor contributes to 
the deleterious effects of P. gingivalis on gut inflammation and liver damage.

BACKGROUND: In the management of locally advanced rectal cancer, organ 
preservation after total neoadjuvant therapy requires complete clinical response 
and close surveillance. Patients with near-complete response or tumor regrowth 
during watch and wait are recommended to undergo total mesorectal excision. 
Selective use of local resection procedures, such as endoscopic submucosal 
dissection, may expand organ preservation in these patients.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of endoscopic 
submucosal dissection for patients with near-complete response or tumor regrowth 
after total neoadjuvant therapy.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: Single tertiary care center.
PATIENTS: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with total 
neoadjuvant therapy between 2015 and 2024 and who underwent endoscopic 
submucosal dissection for near-complete response or tumor regrowth during active 
surveillance.
INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic submucosal dissection for near-complete response and 
tumor regrowth during watch and wait.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Organ preservation and regrowth rates after endoscopic 
submucosal dissection.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were included (40% women, mean age 59.1 ± 13.1 years). 
Although 10 patients underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection for 
near-complete response with endoluminal lesions after total neoadjuvant therapy 
completion, 10 underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection due to tumor regrowth 
during watch and wait. The median time for tumor regrowth was 12.5 months. 
Pathologic examination of specimens showed no invasive cancer in 14 patients 
(70%). Total mesorectal excision was performed in 5 patients in whom invasive 
adenocarcinoma was found on endoscopic submucosal dissection. The 1 remaining 
patient refused proctectomy. One patient with dysplasia, after an additional 
watch-and-wait period after endoscopic submucosal dissection, underwent total 
mesorectal excision to address a second regrowth. Fourteen patients, including 
the one who refused surgery, have been closely monitored to date, with no 
evidence of disease for a mean of 27.7 months.
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design and small sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: Selective use of endoscopic submucosal dissection can be feasible 
and safe for organ preservation in highly selected patients with locally 
advanced rectal cancer after total neoadjuvant therapy. Larger prospective 
trials with longer follow-up are needed to validate its value. See Video 
Abstract.
AMPLIACIN DE LA PRESERVACIN DE RGANOS EN EL CNCER RECTAL LOCALMENTE AVANZADO 
TRAS TERAPIA NEOADYUVANTE TOTAL CON DISECCIN ENDOSCPICA SUBMUCOSA: 
ANTECEDENTES:En el tratamiento del cáncer rectal localmente avanzado, la 
preservación del órgano tras una terapia neoadyuvante total requiere una 
respuesta clínica completa y una vigilancia estrecha. Se recomienda a los 
pacientes con respuesta casi completa o recidiva tumoral durante el periodo de 
observación y espera someterse a una disección mesorrectal total. El uso 
selectivo de procedimientos de resección local, como la disección endoscópica 
submucosa, puede ampliar la preservación del órgano en estos 
pacientes.OBJETIVO:Evaluar la viabilidad, la seguridad y los resultados de la 
disección endoscópica submucosa en pacientes con respuesta casi completa o 
recidiva tumoral tras una terapia neoadyuvante total.DISEÑO:Estudio de cohorte 
retrospectivo.ENTORNO:Centro único de atención terciaria.PACIENTES:Pacientes con 
cáncer rectal localmente avanzado tratados con terapia neoadyuvante total entre 
2015 y 2024, que se sometieron a disección endoscópica submucosa por respuesta 
casi completa o recidiva tumoral durante la vigilancia 
activa.INTERVENCIONES:Disección endoscópica submucosa para la respuesta casi 
completa y el recidiva tumoral durante la vigilancia activa.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS 
DE RESULTADO:Tasas de preservación de órganos y recidiva tras la disección 
endoscópica submucosa.RESULTADOS:Se incluyeron 20 pacientes (40 % mujeres, edad 
media 59,1 ± 13,1 años). Mientras que 10 pacientes se sometieron a disección 
endoscópica submucosa para obtener una respuesta casi completa con lesiones 
endoluminales tras completar la terapia neoadyuvante total, 10 se sometieron a 
disección endoscópica submucosa debido al recidiva tumoral durante la vigilancia 
activa. La mediana del tiempo de recidiva tumoral fue de 12,5 meses. El examen 
patológico de las muestras no reveló cáncer invasivo en 14 pacientes (70 %). Se 
realizó una disección mesorrectal total en cinco pacientes debido al 
adenocarcinoma invasivo encontrado en la disección endoscópica submucosa. El 
otro paciente rechazó la proctectomía. Un paciente con displasia, tras un 
periodo adicional de espera y observación después de la disección endoscópica 
submucosa, se sometió a una extirpación mesorrectal total debido a un segundo 
recidiva. Catorce pacientes, incluido el que rechazó la cirugía, han sido objeto 
de un seguimiento estrecho hasta la fecha, sin evidencia de enfermedad durante 
una media de 27,7 meses.LIMITACIONES:Diseño retrospectivo y tamaño reducido de 
la muestra.CONCLUSIÓN:El uso selectivo de la disección endoscópica submucosa 
puede ser viable y seguro para la preservación de órganos en pacientes altamente 
seleccionados con cáncer rectal localmente avanzado tras terapia neoadyuvante 
total. Se necesitan ensayos prospectivos más amplios con un seguimiento más 
prolongado para validar su valor. (AI-generated translation).

Appropriate disinfection of high-frequency contact surfaces in intensive care 
units (ICUs) is vital for controlling and preventing healthcare-associated 
infections. Two hundred high-frequency contact surfaces in the ICU of Zhejiang 
Provincial People's Hospital-Yuecheng Branch were selected and randomized into 
the trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) or slightly acidic hypochlorous 
electrolyzed water (SAEW) group (100 surfaces per group) for examination from 
April 8, 2024, to May 10, 2024. TCCA solutions containing 500 mg/L of chlorine 
and SAEW were used as disinfectants for wiping and disinfecting the surfaces. 
The bacterial colony count and disinfection pass rate of the two groups at 
5 min, 4 hr, and 8 hr after disinfection were compared. No significant 
differences were found between the TCCA and SAEW groups in 5 min, 4 hr, or 8 hr 
bacterial colony count. At 5 min, 4 hr, and 8 hr after disinfection, the surface 
disinfection pass rates of the TCCA group were 97.00%, 76.00%, and 66.00%, 
respectively, and those of the SAEW group were 96.00%, 73.00%, and 60.00%, 
respectively. The pass rates did not significantly differ (5 min, p = 1.000; 
4 hr, p = 0.626; 8 hr, p = 0.380). The use of SAEW showed comparable results in 
ICU high-frequency contact surface disinfection to the use of TCCA containing 
500 mg/L of chlorine, indicating it is effective for disinfecting high-frequency 
surfaces in ICUs.

BACKGROUND: Virtual health assistants (VHAs), interactive digital programs that 
emulate human communication, are being increasingly used in health care to 
improve patient education and care and to reduce the burden on health care 
providers. VHAs have the potential to promote cancer equity through facilitating 
patient engagement, providing round-the-clock access to information, and 
reducing language barriers. However, it is unclear to what extent 
audience-centeredness is being considered in the development of cancer-related 
applications.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review identifies and synthesizes strategies used to 
make VHA-based cancer prevention and screening interventions audience-centered.
METHODS: Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines, we searched 4 databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of 
Science, and EBSCOhost) for peer-reviewed studies on VHA interventions promoting 
cancer screening (January 2022). Included studies focused on adult populations 
in primary care settings, with interventions emphasizing interactivity and 
immediacy (key VHA features). Excluded studies were on cancer treatment, 
noninteractive decision aids, or technical VHA development. Screening, data 
extraction, and quality assessment (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool) were performed 
independently by multiple reviewers. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze 
audience-centered strategies.
RESULTS: Of 1055 records screened, 17 studies met inclusion criteria. Most 
(n=11) targeted colorectal cancer, with others addressing prostate, breast, 
cervical, or lung cancer. A total of 16 studies were US-based; 1 study focused 
on Uganda. Key strategies for audience-centered design included: (1) Demographic 
Concordance: Race or gender alignment between VHA and users (eg, African 
American participants interacting with Black-coded avatars); (2) User Feedback: 
Iterative testing via interviews, think-aloud protocols, or pilot studies to 
refine interventions; (3) Preintervention Needs Assessment: Identifying 
cultural, linguistic, or literacy barriers (eg, myths about screening in Ugandan 
communities); (4) Theoretical Frameworks: The Health Belief Model (most common), 
the Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability (MAIN) model, or tailored 
messaging theories guided design; (5) Information Customization: Culturally 
adapted content (eg, Spanish-language interfaces, narratives addressing racial 
disparities); and (6) Feature Customization: Adjusting VHA appearance (eg, 
animations and fonts) based on user preferences. Notably, 7/17 studies focused 
on racially minoritized groups (eg, African Americans, Hispanic farmworkers), 
addressing systemic barriers like mistrust in health care. However, gaps 
persisted in intersectional tailoring (eg, rurality and income) and non-English 
languages (only 2/17 studies). Recruitment methods influenced diversity; 
community-based strategies yielded more representative samples than solely 
internet-based recruitment approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review identified the audience-centered development 
practices currently being used for VHA-based interventions in preventive cancer 
care. The majority of the studies included processes to diversify and segment 
the intended audience, focused on medically underrepresented population groups, 
and implemented strategies to be culturally sensitive to the population of 
interest. However, opportunities remain to address multidimensional inequities 
(eg, rural access and low literacy). Future interventions should integrate 
intersectional frameworks, expand language diversity, and measure social 
presence to enhance engagement. This review provides a roadmap for developing 
equity-focused eHealth tools in cancer prevention.

High-fat diet (HFD) is positively correlated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but 
there are notable inter-individual differences in susceptibility to the 
tumor-promoting effects of HFD. A better understanding of the mechanisms that 
modulate the outcomes of HFD could help inform precision prevention strategies 
for CRC. Here, we found a key role for the gut microbiota in the individual 
differences observed in the tumor-promoting effects of HFD. Analysis of the gut 
bacteria enriched in mice resistant to HFD-induced cancer identified 
Lactobacillus johnsonii (L. johnsonii) as an effective protector. Colonization 
of L. johnsonii increased intestinal chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) concentrations 
in HFD-exposed mice, which decelerated HFD-induced CRC progression. 
Mechanistically, L. johnsonii converted conjugated bile acid to CDCA via bile 
salt hydrolase (BSH), and CDCA induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative 
stress to promote apoptosis, effectively suppressing tumor development. These 
results establish the gut microbiota as a mediator of inter-individual 
differences in cancer susceptibility induced by HFD and reveal a probiotic 
strategy with the ability to inhibit tumorigenesis, suggesting a possible route 
to reduce HFD-induced CRC progression.

Zinc Finger and BTB Domain-containing7A (ZBTB7A) is a member of the 
transcription factor family that regulates the expression of numerous genes 
involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Ubiquitously expressed in 
colon, stomach, and other tissues, ZBTB7A performs diverse functions including 
hematopoiesis, metabolism, and oncogenesis. Here we showed that ZBTB7A knockout 
inhibited the growth of colon cancer cells and reduced CD95 protein expression 
by decreasing CD95 mRNA transcription. Overexpression of ZBTB7A could partially 
restore both CD95 expression and CD95-mediated downstream Caspase2 and JNK2 
expression. Furthermore, treatment with ZBTB7A specific inhibitor Curcumin 
effectively induced colorectal cancer cell death while reducing CD95 expression. 
These data indicate that ZBTB7A promotes colon cancer cell growth and survival, 
suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.

Microsatellite instability, a genetic indication of DNA mismatch impairment, 
provides promising treatment options. Our study aimed to detect the mutation 
with whole-slide image (WSI) and discover the most effective pre-trained 
deep-learning model to sort diagnostic slides between high microsatellite 
instability (MSI-H) and microsatellite stable (MSS). WSI data retrieved from 
public dataset were processed for training and evaluating MSI categorization 
model. We detected MSI in slide levels for colorectal cancer (CRC), stomach 
adenocarcinoma (STAD), uterine corpus, and endometrial adenocarcinoma (UCEC). 
Models trained with a single tissue type were evaluated with the test dataset of 
corresponding tissue and subsequently with the test dataset of other types of 
tissue (cross-tissue evaluation). Finally, another model trained with 
multi-tissue types was built to predict the test dataset of individual tissue. 
Our models achieved AUC values of 0.93, 0.84, and 0.79 in TCGA-CRC, TCGA-STAD 
and TCGA-UCEC, respectively. We observed that a model trained on a corresponding 
tumor tissue demonstrates higher accuracy, particularly compared to those 
trained on other tumor tissues. In the combined model trained on multi-tissue, 
we observed diverse outcomes regarding which model was prioritized depending on 
the cancer type. These results demonstrate that models trained on multiple 
tissues have the potential to discern features that are generalizable across 
different types of cancer.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic size estimation of large colorectal polyps 
influences treatment decisions and clinical outcomes; however, its precision 
remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of endoscopic size 
estimation for colorectal lesions ≥ 20 mm utilizing data from an endoscopic 
submucosal dissection (ESD) cohort.
METHODS: This post hoc analysis included only en bloc resected lesions treated 
by ESD. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors, recurrent lesions, 
colitis-associated dysplasia, or insufficient data were excluded. Size accuracy 
was defined as a margin of error < 5 mm. Outcomes included the frequency of size 
errors ≥ 10 mm and ≥ 20 mm, terminal digit preferences in estimated size, and 
predictors for lesions estimated endoscopically at 20 mm but pathologically ≥ 
25 mm. The reference standard was pathological size.
RESULTS: Among 1889 lesions (1809 patients), 61 lesions (60 patients) were 
excluded. Finally, 1828 lesions (1749 patients) were evaluated. The accuracy of 
endoscopic size estimation was 53.4%. Errors ≥ 10 and ≥ 20 mm occurred in 19.1% 
and 4.5% of lesions, respectively. Endoscopic size estimation showed a strong 
terminal digit preference for 0 (65.2%) and 5 (30.0%). Among 366 lesions 
estimated at 20 mm, 97 (26.5%) were pathologically ≥ 25 mm. Polypoid lesions 
[odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-6.8] and laterally 
spreading tumors granular type (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.5) were predictors of 
underestimation.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic size estimation of large colorectal lesions can be 
inaccurate and influenced by digit bias, underscoring the need for improved 
measurement techniques (UMIN000010136).

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health challenge, ranking as the 
third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide. Its development is influenced by several risk factors, including 
smoking, diets rich in red meat, and the effects of stress-related hormones such 
as epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones act through β-adrenergic 
receptors (β-ARs), which are present on CRC cells and are associated with 
cancer-promoting processes such as increased cell growth, invasion, blood vessel 
formation, and accelerated disease progression. Notably, β-ARs blockers have 
shown potential in slowing CRC progression, pointing to a promising therapeutic 
strategy. This review explores the main signaling pathways through which β-ARs 
contribute to cancer development and how various risk factors may influence 
these mechanisms. We also provide an overview of current preclinical and 
clinical studies on β-AR blockers in CRC, identify existing gaps in knowledge, 
and propose directions for future research to optimize therapeutic outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in Germany has 
declined in recent years. Nevertheless, colorectal cancer is still the second 
most common cancer in women (after breast cancer) and the third most common in 
men in Germany (after prostate cancer and lung cancer). Screening for colorectal 
cancer is well-established in many countries. The two most recommended screening 
strategies are colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT, stool test for 
occult blood).
OBJECTIVE: This article explains important conceptual and practical differences 
between the two strategies offered in Germany and summarizes the latest 
high-quality evidence for the benefits of the most frequently used screening 
tests. The aim is to provide physicians with decision aids for patients who show 
interest in colorectal cancer screening.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Confirmed high-quality evidence from randomized trials on 
the benefits of screening for colorectal cancer with respect to incidence and 
mortality.
RESULTS: The lifetime risk to develop colorectal cancer in Germany is 5% for 
women and 6.5% for men. According to a large randomized trial, a screening 
colonoscopy reduces the risk of colorectal cancer from 1.2% to 0.8-0.9% after 
10 years. New high-quality evidence from a recent Spanish randomized trial also 
showed that the benefits of FIT screening every other year are comparable to 
those of 1 colonoscopy over 10 years. The risks of perforation and bleeding 
during colonoscopy are 0.01% and 0.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: During the medical patient clarification on screening, it is 
recommended that the abovenamed facts on benefits and risks should be included 
and explained.

ERGEBNISSE: Das Lebenszeitrisiko in Deutschland, an Darmkrebs zu erkranken, 
beträgt derzeit 5 % bei Frauen und 6,5 % bei Männern. Laut einer großen 
randomisierten Studie reduziert eine Vorsorgekoloskopie das Risiko von Darmkrebs 
über 10 Jahre von 1,2 % auf ungefähr 0,8–0,9 %. Neue Evidenz einer großen 
spanischen randomisierten Studie zeigt, dass der Nutzen eines FIT-Screenings 
jedes zweite Jahr als gleichwertig zur einer Koloskopie über 10 Jahre 
einzuordnen ist. Das Risiko einer Perforation während einer Koloskopie liegt bei 
ungefähr 0,01 %, und das Risiko einer Blutung bei 0,1 %.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Bei der ärztlichen Patientenaufklärung zum Screening wird 
empfohlen, die oben genannten Zahlen für Nutzen und Risiko heranzuziehen und zu 
erklären.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal cancer of the bile duct and is a major 
health concern in several parts of the world, including northeastern Thailand, 
where CCA incidence is the highest due to the endemic liver fluke Opisthorchis 
viverrini. Multiple studies have characterised genomic alterations in CCA 
tumours, and specific chromosomal alterations can predict prognosis. However, it 
is not known whether chromosomal instability (CIN), ongoing genomic alteration 
characteristic of most cancer types, is present in CCA tumours. In this study we 
leveraged a panel of cancer cell lines derived from fluke-positive CCA patients, 
as well as a matched normal cholangiocyte line as a control, to characterise CIN 
in CCA. We observed elevated rates of chromosome segregation errors compared to 
normal cells, although overall CIN rates were lower than those for highly 
genomically unstable cancers, such as colorectal or ovarian cancer. Chromosome 
segregation errors in CCA cell lines were potentially driven by elevated DNA 
replication stress and centrosome duplication. Single-cell genome sequencing and 
karyotyping of the cell lines showed extensive structural and numerical 
chromosomal aberrations, as well as copy number alterations that were 
heterogeneous between individual cells, supporting the presence of ongoing CIN 
in these cell line models. Low-pass whole-genome sequencing of 33 CCA tumour 
samples with matched normal tissue from northeastern Thailand, a liver 
fluke-endemic region showed increased whole and subchromosomal level 
alterations, with a higher extent of genomic alterations in intrahepatic tumours 
compared to extrahepatic. Eight tumours carried focal amplifications and/or 
deletions involving known cancer genes, as well as potential chromosomal 
instability-associated genes, including CCNE1 amplifications and a rare 
amplification of BRCA1. This study provides increased understanding of the rate 
and potential mechanisms of CIN in CCA that may inform new therapeutic 
strategies that synergise with specific ongoing CIN mechanisms. © 2025 The

BACKGROUND: Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered one of the lethal 
neoplasms globally. The embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), a 
crucial enzyme regulating glycolysis, promotes tumor cell proliferation and 
metastasis, and is correlated with unfavourable outcomes among several cancers, 
including CRC.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 80 de novo metastatic CRC 
patients at the Medical Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute 
(SECI), Assiut University, from June 2022 to June 2024. We analyzed the impact 
of PKM2 expression, evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in metastatic CRC 
patients, and response to first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimens and 
survival outcomes in the form of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS).
RESULT: The median age of the studied cases was 47 ys, 42 (52.5%) were male, and 
54 (67.5%) were left-sided. Our results revealed a statistically significant 
association between high PKM2 IHC expression and lower overall response rate 
(ORR), P = 0.001. After a median follow-up time of 13 months(ms), this 
translated into a statistically significant association between the high PKM2 
IHC expression group and lower PFS and OS (6ms vs 10ms; P = 0.008), (12ms vs. 
17ms; P = 0.008), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results concluded that PKM2 IHC expression was one of the 
independent prognostic factors for OS. This supports the consideration of PKM2 
as a promising molecular target for therapeutic strategies in CRC management.

The aim of the study was to investigate the level of heat shock proteins (HSPs) 
and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) on circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) 
with the assessment to use EV markers to predict cancer risk in patients with 
colon adenomas and polyps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiparametric staining with flow cytometric 
visualization was performed to assess the expression of MMPs and HSPs on EVs 
isolated from blood plasma. Vesicles were characterized using transmission 
electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and flow cytometry. Groups 
of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) n=40 (26 women and 14 men, T2-4N0-2M0, 
mean age 59.6±1.61 years) and patients with villous adenomas of the colon (CA) 
(n=20, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 57.5±10.55 years, with obesity, defined as a 
body mass index ≥30 kg/m² were formed. Logistic regression was used to calculate 
the cancer risk.
RESULTS: The logistic regression model for predicting the cancer risk in 
patients with CA with obesity included both CD9-positive EVs and the 
adipocyte-derived FABP4-positive EVs. Clinical parameters were not significant 
as indicators for predicting the cancer risk. The sensitivity and specificity of 
this model were 85.4% and 79.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The advantages of the calculated mathematical model are as follows: 
1) the parameters included in the model are estimated in the blood plasma EVs, 
thereby not requiring invasive procedures (colonoscopy, biopsy sampling); 2) the 
model takes into account the presence of metabolic disorders, since the model 
includes subpopulations of CD9-positive vesicles and FABP4-positive 
(adipocyte-derived) EVs as predictors of cancer risk; 3) the calculation of 
cancer risk using this model can be repeated. This version of the application of 
the model can consider changes in cancer risk and allows optimization of 
management tactics for CA patients.

OBJECTIVE: This research focuses on molecular screening of mRNA by targeting EMT 
regulator genes in the TGF-β/SMAD pathway to determine the difference in EMT 
mechanisms between non-metastatic and metastatic primary tumor cells.
METHODS: The method uses Real time/quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction 
(RT-qPCR) to measure the expression levels of target genes in colon tissue 
samples from non-metastatic and metastatic patient groups. Differences in target 
gene expression between the two groups were analyzed using t-tests.
RESULTS: The results of this study show significance differences in the 
expression of EMT-inducing genes on the TGF-β/Smad pathway between 
non-metastatic colorectal cancer groups and metastases. TGF-β1 (p-value : 
0.041), Smad2 (p-value : 0.020), Snail1 (p-value : 0.028), Twist1 (p-value : 
0.036), and ZEB1 (p-value : 0.045) gene expression was higher in the metastatic 
tumor group. In contrast to these genes, the expression of the Smad4 (p-value : 
0.022), E-cadherin (p-value : 0.036), and vimentin (p-value : 0.048) genes was 
lower in the metastatic tumor group.
CONCLUSION: The observed alterations in gene expression related to EMT within 
the TGF-β/Smad pathway in metastatic colorectal cancer are likely associated 
with the partial processes of EMT and MET. These alterations may contribute to 
further metastatic potential and increase the malignancy of the cancer.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether Human alpha-1 antitrypsin 
affects Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) as well as 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression using a colon cancer tissues 
in chemically induced colorectal cancer (CRC) model. Previous study indicated a 
protective role of AAT administration on the development of cancer in CRC mouse 
model.
METHODOLOGY: The expression of PD1/PDL1 and EGFR were analyzed in colon cancer 
tissue collected from (AOM/DSS) CRC mice using both real time gene expression 
(qPCR) and immunohistochemistry(IHC).
RESULTS: Study results showed that AAT treatment reduced PD-L1 protein 
expression by 63.5% (mean H score: 7.8±1.3 to 2.85±0.85, p=0.0004) and EGFR 
protein expression by 48.9% (mean H score: 1.78±0.76 to 0.91±0.60, p=0.04) in 
the tissue of AOM/DSS-treated mice. In addition, AAT treatment controlled PD1 
gene expression and repressed EGFR gene expression by 1.4-fold compared to DSS 
samples. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed various degrees of PD1 protein 
expression, and CD4 and CD8 positive lymphocytes were found in the tumor 
microenvironment.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that AAT treatment has immunomodulatory 
properties and may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for colon cancer.

cancer prognosis.

The intratumoral microbiota has been identified as an indispensable part of the 
tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the relationship between the intratumoral 
microbiota and host gene expression, as well as its impact on prognosis and TME 
immunity, remains unclear. We utilized a machine learning-based framework to 
identify microbiota-host gene associations across 14 tumors from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and validated them in 11 tumors from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus. By calculating immune scores and identifying immune-related microbiota, 
we developed both a pan-cancer Immune and Prognosis-Related Microbial Score 
(IPRMS) and cancer-specific IPRMSs and analyzed the relationship between the 
cancer-specific IPRMSs and immune infiltration at bulk level and single-cell 
level. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the potential mechanisms in which 
the intratumoral microbiota might affect prognosis using survival mediation 
analyses (SMAs). We identified gene subsets associated with microbiota, which 
were predominantly enriched in immune-related and cell signaling regulation 
pathways. Subsequently, we constructed the overall survival-related IPRMS and 
found that high-IPRMS patients had poorer prognosis in pan-cancer and increased 
presence of macrophage and cancer-associated fibroblasts. In contrast, low-IPRMS 
patients showed enrichment in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. SMAs suggest that 
intratumoral microbiota may influence prognosis by affecting immune cells, 
pathways, and host genes. High-IPRMSs were consistently associated with poorer 
prognosis and lower abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. At the 
single-cell level, cancer-associated fibroblasts were predominantly enriched in 
the high-IPRMS group, while tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were also mainly 
enriched in the low-IPRMS group. Our research indicates that the intratumoral 
microbiota was associated with immune and prognosis, which may impact the cancer 
prognosis by modifying immune cells, pathways, and host gene expression.
IMPORTANCE: The intratumoral microbiota is a vital part of the tumor 
microenvironment, yet its interplay with host gene expression and immune 
regulation remains unclear. Based on a machine learning framework for the 
interaction analysis of intratumoral microbiota and host genes, as well as the 
construction of the Immune and Prognosis-Related Microbial Score, our findings 
suggest that intratumoral microbiota may influence gene expression by affecting 
host pathways, especially immune-related pathways. Moreover, immune-related 
intratumoral microbiota are significantly associated with patient survival and 
TME immunity and may influence prognosis by affecting immune cells, pathways, or 
gene expression, offering new perspectives and potential biomarkers for 
predicting personalized patient prognosis in the future.

Joint Surgery, Huai'an, China.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery, while minimally invasive, 
induces systemic oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune dysfunction through 
surgical trauma and anesthesia-related stress. Esketamine, an NMDA receptor 
antagonist with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, may mitigate these 
biochemical perturbations. This study evaluated esketamine's effects on serum 
biomarkers of oxidative stress (glutathione, catalase, malondialdehyde, 
superoxide dismutase), inflammatory mediators (TNF-a, CRP IL-6), and T 
lymphocyte subsets in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer 
resection.
METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 150 stage I-II colorectal cancer 
patients were allocated to esketamine (0.25 mg/kg bolus + 0.12 mg/kg/h infusion) 
or control (saline) groups during standardized anesthesia. Preand postoperative 
serum levels of oxidative stress markers (GSH, CAT, MDA, SOD), inflammatory 
cytokines (TNF-a, CRP IL-6), and immune cell subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio) were quantified via ELISA and flow cytometry. Statistical 
analysis compared intergroup differences using t-tests and chi-square tests.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, the esketamine group exhibited significantly 
attenuated oxidative stress, with higher GSH (72.43± 6.63 vs. 60 .1 6± 5.57 
mg/mL, P < 0.05), CAT (92.56± 8.31 vs. 82.81 ± 7.75 U/mL), and SOD (84.53± 8.02 
vs. 69 .93± 7.05 nU/mL), alongside lower MDA (6.41± 0.52 vs. 9.52± 0.63 mmol/L). 
Pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced (TNF-a: 4 0 .32 ± 4.84 vs. 54.37± 5.80 
pg/mL; IL-6: 50.83± 5.05 vs. 82 .38± 8.46 pg/mL, P < 0.05). Immune function 
preservation was evident through elevated CD3+ (4 5 .1 8 ± 5 .0 1 % vs. 37 .05 ± 
4.92% ) and CD4+ T cells (26.51 ±2.76% vs. 19.78± 2.09%), with a balanced 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio (1.12± 0.12 vs. 0.72± 0.09).
CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine-based anesthesia significantly ameliorates postoperative 
oxidative damage, suppresses inflammatory cytokine release, and preserves 
cellular immune homeostasis, as evidenced by targeted biochemical and 
immunological analyses. These findings highlight esketamine's role in modulating 
perioperative biochemical pathways, potentially enhancing recovery in colorectal 
cancer surgery.

Publisher: UVOD: Laparoskopska hirurgija kolorektalnog karcinoma, iako je 
minimalno invazivna, izaziva sistemski oksidativni stres, upalu i imunološku 
disfunkciju kroz hiruršku traumu i stres povezan sa anestezijom. Esketamin, 
antagonist NMDA receptora sa antioksidativnim i antiinflamatornim svojstvima, 
može ublažiti ove biohemijske poremećaje. Ova studija je procenila efekte 
esketamina na serumske bio-markere oksidativnog stresa (glutation, katalaza, 
malondi-aldehid, superoksid dismutaza), inflamatorne medijatore (TNF-a, CRIP 
IL-6) i podgrupe T limfocita kod pacijenata koji su podvrgnuti laparoskopskoj 
laparoskopskoj boji karci-noma u boji.
METODE: U ovom randomizovanom kontrolisanom ispitiva-nju, 150 pacijenata sa 
kolorektalnim karcinomom stadiju-ma I-II dodeljeno je esketamin (0,25 mg/kg 
bolus + 0,12 mg/kg/h infuzija) ili kontrolnoj (fiziološki rastvor) grupama tokom 
standardizovane anestezije. Prei postoperativni serumski nivoi markera 
oksidativnog stresa (GSH, CAT, MDA, SOD), inflamatornih citokina (TNF-a, CRP 
IL-6) i podskupova imunih ćelija (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+ odnos) su 
kvantifikovani putem ELISA testa i testa. Statistička analiza je upoređivala 
međugrupne razlike koriš-tenjem t-testova i hi-kvadrat testova.
REZULTATI: Postoperativno, grupa koja je primala esketamin pokazala je značajno 
smanjen oksidativni stres, sa višim GSH (72,43± 6,63 naspram 60,16± 5,57 mg/mL, 
P < 0,05), CAT (92,56±8,31 naspram 82,81 ±7,75 U/mL) i SOD (84,53± 8,02 naspram 
69,93± 7,05 nU/mL), uz niži MDA (6,41± 0,52 naspram 9,52± 0,63 mmol/L). 
Proinflamatorni citokini su bili smanj'eni (TNF-a: 40,32± 4,84 naspram 54,37± 
5,80 pg/mL; IL-6: 50,83± 5,05 naspram 82,38± 8,46 pg/mL, P < 0,05). Očuvanje 
imunološke funkcij'e bilo j'e evidentno kroz povišene CD3+ (45,18±5,01% naspram 
37,05±4,92% ) i CD4+ T celij'e (26,51 ±2,76% naspram 19,78±2,09% ), sa 
uravnoteženim odnosom C D 4+/C d 8+ (1,12± 0,12 naspram 0,72± 0,09).
ZAKLJUČAK: Anestezija zasnovana na esketaminu značajno ublažava postoperativna 
oksidativna oštećenja, potiskuje otpuštanj'e inflamatornih citokina i čuva 
ćelij'sku imuno-lošku homeostazu, što j'e dokazano ciljanim biohemijskim i 
imunološkim analizama. Ovi nalazi naglašavaju ulogu eske-tamina u modulaciji 
perioperativnih biohemijskih puteva, potencijalno poboljšavajući oporavak u 
hirurgiji kolorek-talnog karcinoma.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide, necessitating the need for an effective therapeutic strategy. Beta 
vulgaris (beetroot) possesses active compounds that exert anti-cancer 
properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of beetroot as a 
preventative agent against the progression of CRC using differentially expressed 
gene (DEG) analysis and network pharmacology approaches. The protein-protein 
interaction network and molecular docking analyses were employed to assess the 
key interactions of beetroot active compounds with CRC-related target protein. 
Cytotoxicity of beetroot extract was experimentally evaluated using 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on the 
HT29 cell line. The result of this study showed that protein in the cell cycle 
was significantly enriched in CRC, with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) gene as 
one of the specific genes. Quercetin, galangin, hesperidin, farrerol, and 
betanin were the most typical compounds of beetroot based on the Comparative 
Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Molecular docking studies revealed the strong 
binding affinity between quercetin (-7.04 kcal/mol) and bentanin (-8.11 
kcal/mol) with CDK4. Beetroot demonstrated anticancer properties against the 
HT29 cell line with IC50 value of 39.03±1.4 µg/mL. In conclusion, the beetroot 
extract has inhibitory activity against HT29 cell line proliferation, 
highlighting its potential in preventing the development of CRC through the 
substantial suppression of gene expression within the cell cycle pathway.

Lactococcus lactis D4 is a probiotic produced through the fermentation of 
buffalo milk in bamboo, namely "dadih", a traditional food from West Sumatera, 
Indonesia. To the best of our knowledge, no specific research has investigated 
the effects of L. lactis D4, derived from dadih extraction, on colorectal cancer 
or its potential clinical applications. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
evaluate the potential of L. lactis D4 from dadih to inhibit colorectal cancer 
growth in rat models, with a focus on its effects on cell proliferation, 
apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. An in vivo study was conducted using 37 
male Sprague-Dawley rats, allocated into five groups: (1) control (no 
treatment), (2) dysplasia (induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine until dysplasia 
developed), (3) dysplasia + L. lactis D4 (induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, 
then treated with L. lactis D4 after dysplasia confirmation), (4) cancer 
(induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine until cancer was confirmed), and (5) cancer 
+ L. lactis D4 (induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine until cancer was confirmed, 
then treated with L. lactis D4 for 15 days). The effects of L. lactis D4 on 
cancer progression were assessed through immunohistochemical analysis of cell 
proliferation (cyclin D1, Bcl-2), apoptosis (p53, caspase-3), and inflammation 
(nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)). This study found that 
L. lactis D4 treatment reduced adenocarcinoma and dysplasia severity in 
colorectal cancer models through significant reduction in cyclin D1, Bcl-2, 
NF-κB, and COX-2 expression observed across all groups (p<0.01), although 
changes in dysplasia and cancer subgroups were not statistically significant 
(p>0.05). No statistically significant change was noted in p53 expression 
(p=0.518), whereas caspase-3 expression varied significantly across groups 
(p=0.010). In conclusion, L. lactis D4 reduces the expression of cyclin D1, 
Bcl-2, NF-κB, and COX-2 proteins, offering insights into its potential to 
modulating proliferation and inflammation in colorectal cancer growth.

Cancer cells reprogram the metabolism of glucose, lipids, and proteins (amino 
acids) to meet their energy needs during tumor initiation and progression. Amino 
acid sensing pathways play rucial roles in the progression and spread of 
colorectal cancer (CRC), but the crosstalk between these pathways and glucose 
and lipid metabolism has not been systematically elucidated. We summarize the 
roles of key amino acids in CRC, the corresponding nutrient sensors, the 
associated dysregulated signaling pathways, and their subcellular localization. 
Furthermore, we highlight how disrupted amino acid sensing forms an integrated 
regulatory network that modulates glucose and lipid metabolism through multiple 
signaling cascades. These insights reveal both opportunities for clinical 
translation and unresolved challenges in the field. We believe that this 
comprehensive review will stimulate further research in this emerging area and 
draw significant attention from both the scientific community and broader 
audiences. This review aims to identify new diagnostic markers, therapeutic 
targets, and prognostic indicators by enhancing the understanding of nutrient 
metabolic pathway interactions.

Background Physical activity (PA) is an established protective factor for 
colorectal cancer (CRC), but it is unclear if genetic variants modify this 
effect. To investigate this possibility, we conducted a genome-wide gene-PA 
interaction analysis. Methods Using logistic regression and two-step and joint 
tests, we analyzed interactions between common genetic variants across the 
genome and PA in relation to CRC risk. Self-reported PA levels were categorized 
as active (≥ 8.75 MET-h/wk) vs. inactive (< 8.75 MET-h/wk) and as study- and 
sex-specific quartiles of activity. Results PA had an overall protective effect 
on CRC (OR [active vs. inactive] = 0.85; 95%CI = 0.81-0.90). The two-step GxE 
method identified an interaction between rs4779584, an intergenic variant near 
the GREM1 and SCG5 genes, and PA for CRC risk (p-interaction = 2.6×10 - 8 ). 
Stratification by genotype at this locus showed a significant reduction in CRC 
risk by 20% in active vs. inactive participants with the CC genotype (OR = 0.80; 
95%CI = 0.75-0.85), but no significant PA-CRC association among CT or TT 
carriers. When PA was modeled as quartiles, the 1-d.f. GxE test identified that 
rs56906466, an intergenic variant near the KCNG1 gene, modified the association 
between PA and CRC (p-interaction = 3.5×10 - 8 ). Stratification at this locus 
showed that increase in PA (highest vs. lowest quartile) was associated with a 
lower CRC risk solely among TT carriers (OR = 0.77; 95%CI = 0.72-0.82). 
Conclusions In summary, we identified two genetic variants that modified the 
association between PA and CRC risk. One of them, related to GREM1 and SCG5 , 
suggests that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-related, inflammatory, and/or 
insulin signaling pathways may be associated with the protective influence of PA 
on colorectal carcinogenesis.

A 40-year-old man with a recent deep vein thrombosis presented with chronic 
abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, night sweats, and significant weight loss. 
Imaging and colonoscopy revealed a stenosing transverse colon adenocarcinoma 
with loss of MSH2 expression, confirming microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) 
status. Molecular tests were negative for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations. The 
patient received four cycles of pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy but 
required emergency subtotal colectomy for recurrent obstruction. Histopathology 
showed no residual tumor, negative lymph nodes, and pT0N0M0 staging, indicating 
a complete pathological response. This case illustrates the potential of 
short-course neoadjuvant immunotherapy to induce complete regression in MSI-H 
colorectal cancer and supports its safe integration into the surgical management 
of such tumors, even in emergency settings.

BACKGROUND: PDZ domain-containing protein 8 (PDZD8) has been implicated in the 
progression of colorectal cancer. However, its regulatory mechanisms and 
functional impact remain to be fully elucidated. We assessed PDZD8 expression in 
colorectal cancer cell lines and normal colorectal mucosa using Real-time 
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
METHODS: The role of PDZD8 in colorectal cancer was further investigated through 
the generation of PDZD8-depleted HCT 116 and RKO cell models via short hairpin 
RNA (shRNA) interference. The influence of PDZD8 knockdown on cellular 
phenotypes was examined through proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and cell 
cycle assays. Additionally, the regulatory effect of miR-1283 on PDZD8 was 
explored both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: PDZD8 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly upregulated in 
colorectal cancer cell lines compared to normal mucosa, with the highest 
expression in RKO and HCT 116 cells. PDZD8 knockdown impeded cell proliferation 
and migration while promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro. 
Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assays confirmed miR-1283 as a 
negative regulator of PDZD8. In vitro and in vivo, PDZD8 overexpression 
modulated cell viability and migration, increased tumor volume and weight in 
nude mice, and miR-1283 overexpression counteracted the pro-oncogenic effects of 
PDZD8.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that PDZD8 was a critical promoter of 
malignant phenotypes in colorectal cancer, and its expression was negatively 
regulated by miR-1283. Targeting the PDZD8/miR-1283 axis may offer a therapeutic 
strategy for colorectal cancer.

Dalian, China.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is steadily increasing, and 
its standard treatment regimen improves the survival rate of tumor patients, but 
metastatic CRC is the main cause of death in CRC patients. As a low-toxicity 
natural compound, curcumin, a traditional Chinese medicine, can effectively 
inhibit the growth of tumor cells by mediating various biological processes. 
This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying curcumin in 
the treatment of CRC using a combination of network pharmacology analysis and 
experimental validation.
METHODS: The GeneCards database was used to identify potential targets 
associated with CRC and apoptosis. Target concentrations for curcumin and 
apoptosis were identified from the Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals 
(STITCH) and GeneCards databases, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment 
analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment 
analysis were conducted using the 'clusterprofile' package in R software. 
Furthermore, to examine the impact of curcumin on the viability and apoptosis of 
colon cancer cell lines, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and flow cytometry 
analyses were performed. Lastly, Western blot analysis was conducted to validate 
curcumin's effects on proapoptotic protein.
RESULTS: A total of 25 essential genes were identified for protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network construction and enrichment analysis. The results of 
the CCK-8 assay indicated that curcumin exerted inhibitory effects on in vitro 
proliferation. Moreover, the results of flow cytometry demonstrated that 
curcumin triggered apoptosis in SW480 cells and HCT116 cells. Finally, western 
blot analysis revealed that curcumin down-regulated the expression of MDM2 and 
COX-2.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a possible therapeutic approach for CRC by 
modulating key genes associated with apoptosis, such as MDM2 and COX-2, offering 
a novel therapeutic strategy for CRC.

Metabolomic Biomarkers and Signature of Ultra-processed Foods Intake and 
Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality.

Wang L, Yang J, Chen J, Rebholz CM, Shu XO, Shrubsole MJ, Gupta DK, Lipworth L, 
Ma S, Dai Q, Zheng W, Yu D.

Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) intake may increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
risk, but the mechanisms remain unclear and evidence on UPF biomarkers is 
limited. Leveraging untargeted blood metabolomics in three prospective cohorts, 
we identified and validated circulating metabolites associated with UPF intake 
and CVD risk and mortality. Discovery was conducted in the Southern Community 
Cohort Study (N=1,688), with validation in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and 
Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (N=2,315) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities Study (N=3,682). We identified (n=142) and validated (n=43) 
metabolites associated with UPF intake, with several of these metabolites 
further linked to incident coronary heart disease (n=5), CVD mortality (n=2), 
and total mortality (n=20). Importantly, we developed a metabolite signature for 
UPF intake, which demonstrated strong associations with outcomes 
(OR/HR=1.25-1.46 per 1-SD increase) and explained 59-77% of the UPF-disease 
associations. These findings may enhance the assessment and mechanistic 
understanding of how UPFs impact human health.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising globally, with China bearing the 
highest burden. Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) significantly impacts 
postoperative patients' well-being but remains understudied in China. The roles 
of illness perception, emotional distress, and social support in FCR are 
unclear. This study aims to assess FCR levels and identify influencing factors 
to guide early clinical intervention.
METHODS: From November 2023 to May 2024, a cross-sectional survey was conducted 
among 314 postoperative CRC patients at a tertiary cancer hospital in Shanghai. 
Eligible adults (≥18 years) with confirmed CRC who had completed primary 
treatment were recruited via convenience sampling. Validated questionnaires were 
completed independently or with staff assistance. These included the Fear of 
Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI), the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire 
(BIPQ), the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the 15-Item Social Constraints 
Scale (SCS-15), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Pearson 
correlation analysis was conducted to examine associations among FCR, illness 
perception, social factors, and psychological symptoms. Subsequently, 
multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify independent 
predictors of high FCR.
RESULTS: Of the 330 questionnaires distributed, 314 were deemed valid, yielding 
a response rate of 95.2%. The sample included 193 males (61.5%) and 121 females 
(38.5%), with a mean age of 59.7±12.3 years. Participants showed a high level of 
FCR, with a mean FCRI score of 69.64±27.10 and severity dimension score of 
13.91±5.996. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in age, 
monthly income, and residence between high and low-to-moderate FCR groups 
(P<0.05). The high FCR group had greater illness perception (BIPQ), higher 
social constraints (SCS-15), elevated anxiety and depression (P<0.001), and 
lower social support (SSRS; P=0.01) compared to the low-to-moderate group. 
Correlation analysis showed that FCR was significantly positively correlated 
with illness perception (r=0.548, P<0.01), social constraints (SCS-15; r=0.275, 
P<0.01), and psychological distress, including anxiety (r=0.596, P<0.01) and 
depression (r=0.426, P<0.01), highlighting the interplay among cognitive, 
social, and emotional factors. Subsequent binary logistic regression analysis 
identified illness perception and anxiety symptoms as significant independent 
predictors of FCR in patients with CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: FCR is common among postoperative CRC patients and is strongly 
linked to illness perception and anxiety. These findings underscore the need for 
routine psychological screening and tailored communication. Interventions 
addressing maladaptive beliefs and emotional distress, along with integrated 
psychoeducational and psychosocial support, may enhance resilience and improve 
quality of life in survivorship care.

Colorectal cancer prognosis: insights from the tumor immune microenvironment and 
gut microbiota.

Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. 
Despite recent advancements in screening strategies and treatments, the 
prognosis of CRC patients remains poor. Emerging evidences suggest that tumor 
immune microenvironment (TIME) and gut microbiota play a pivotal role in CRC 
progression and treatment. However, the clinical utility of these findings 
remains limited due to the absence of robust biomarkers. We sought to establish 
a clinically actionable tool that could guide personalized treatment decisions 
and ultimately improve outcomes for CRC patients.
METHODS: We analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and identified the prognostic genes for CRC by 
integrating the TIME- and gut microbiota-related genes from GeneCards. Using 
Mendelian randomization (MR), we examined the causal relationships between the 
prognostic genes, gut microbiota, and CRC. We then developed a risk model and 
independently validated its predictive performance using The Cancer Genome 
Atlas-Colon Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COADREAD) dataset as an external validation 
cohort.
RESULTS: We established a risk model comprising the six identified genes and 
found that the high-risk group had a significantly higher mortality rate than 
the low-risk group. Additionally, the high-risk group showed increased immune 
cell infiltration and a diminished response to immunotherapy. The two-step MR 
analysis revealed that Deltaproteobacteria and Methanobrevibacter mediated the 
causal relationship between the prognostic genes and CRC. Further, the risk 
score was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for CRC survival, and the 
newly established nomogram demonstrated strong concordance between the predicted 
and observed clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a six-gene risk model and showed that gut microbes 
mediate the causal link between the prognostic genes and CRC. Further research 
on the regulation of the TIME and gut microbiota in CRC may provide valuable 
insights.

BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, including autophagy, 
ferroptosis, cuproptosis, neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), and 
paraptosis, are central to tumor biology and hold potential as therapeutic 
targets in colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study is to use multi-omics 
data to analyze the role of PCD in CRC.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-omics analysis using data from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA), single-cell sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics to investigate 
the expression profiles, prognostic significance, and functional effects of 
PCD-associated genes in CRC. Key prognostic genes were identified through gene 
set variation analysis (GSVA), single-sample gene set enrichment analysis 
(ssGSEA), univariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) regression modeling.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified five PCD pathways with significant prognostic 
relevance in CRC, particularly autophagy and cuproptosis. Pan-cancer analyses 
highlighted unique and shared expression patterns of PCD-related genes across 
diverse cancer types, revealing their differential roles in cancer progression. 
Dynamic network biomarker (DNB) modeling pinpointed stage-specific critical 
transitions in PCD pathway activity, suggesting temporal variations in pathway 
influence on tumor progression. Functional assays demonstrated that 
overexpression of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), an autophagy-related 
gene, suppressed CRC cell migration and invasion while promoting apoptosis, 
validating its anti-tumor role in CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the prognostic significance of PCD pathways 
in CRC, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. By 
identifying core genes within these pathways and elucidating their temporal 
effects on tumor progression, we provide a comprehensive foundation for future 
research into PCD-targeted therapies in CRC, aiming to enhance personalized 
treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global health burden characterized by 
significant morbidity and mortality rates. While current therapeutic strategies, 
including surgical intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy, have shown moderate 
success, patients with advanced-stage CRC frequently encounter substantial 
therapeutic obstacles, primarily stemming from acquired drug resistance and 
tumor immune evasion. Emerging research suggests that phytochemicals are 
promising therapeutic candidates due to their pleiotropic regulatory capacities, 
particularly their capability to modulate immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) 
resistance pathways. These bioactive compounds could be used to develop novel 
therapeutic approaches based on the epigenetic reprogramming of tumor cells and 
the remodeling of the metabolism-immune crosstalk axis in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). This study aimed to investigate the effects and 
underlying mechanisms of andrographolide in targeting mitochondrial function and 
remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment in CRC.
METHODS: This study used Cell Counting Kit-8, live and dead cell staining, 
immunofluorescence, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow 
analysis (using CT26 cells), and mouse xenografts to explore the anti-tumor 
effect and mechanism of andrographolide, a natural product, in CRC.
RESULTS: By targeting the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) protein, 
andrographolide affects the mitochondrial membrane potential of CRC cells, 
activates the natural immune pathway of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase 
(cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) during tumor proliferation, and 
reshapes the TME of CRC by recruiting dendric cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T 
cells, and reducing immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the anti-tumor effect of andrographolide in CRC 
and the mechanism of immune metabolism regulation. Our findings provide a 
theoretical basis for the application of natural products in CRC immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Palliative chemotherapy is the standard first treatment for patients 
with ≥10 liver metastases, irrespective of resectability. This study aimed to 
assess the clinical benefits of hepatic resection and identify optimal 
treatments for colorectal cancer patients with ≥10 liver-limited metastases 
(LLMs).
METHODS: A retrospective study of 373 patients with unresectable colorectal 
cancer and ≥10 liver metastases. Patients were grouped into hepatic surgery ± 
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) + systemic therapy, RFA + systemic therapy, and 
systemic therapy alone. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods were 
used to analyze overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A 
nomogram was developed and validated.
RESULTS: Three-year survival rates were 39.2%, 18.6%, and 8.2% for surgery ± RFA 
+ systemic, RFA + systemic, and systemic only groups, respectively. Significant 
survival differences were noted in both KRAS/NRAS/BRAF wildtype and mutated 
cohorts. For wildtype LLMs, OS and PFS were 39.3 and 13.8 months for surgery ± 
RFA + systemic, compared to 23.9 and 9.9 months for RFA + systemic. The nomogram 
(C-index =0.709) identified independent prognostic factors for OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatectomy, with or without RFA, is associated with significantly 
improved survival in selected patients with ≥10 liver metastases. Further 
prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: The 5-year overall survival (OS) for stage IV pancreatic cancer is 
dismal despite aggressive systemic therapy. Stereotactic body radiation therapy 
(SBRT) involves delivering precise, highly conformal, and biologically effective 
doses of radiation via a linear accelerator to the tumor region. Clinical trials 
have shown improvement in OS and progression-free survival (PFS) with SBRT plus 
standard chemotherapy in oligometastatic (<5 metastatic lesions) solid tumors 
such as breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers, when compared to 
chemotherapy alone. Factors predicting response to SBRT need to be further 
explored in oligometastatic pancreatic cancer (oPC). The study aims to assess 
the role of SBRT in the management of patients with oPC.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of oPC patients treated at 
the Mayo Clinic during the period from January 2012 to January 2022, who 
underwent SBRT to at least one site, including the primary site and/or sites of 
metastases, received at least 4 months of chemotherapy, and had a minimum of 
1-year follow-up. Pertinent data were collected from the electronic health 
records after institutional review board (IRB) approval. The response rates 
(RRs) were assessed using the RECIST v1.1 criteria, and the PFS and OS were 
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox regression was used 
to determine a statistically significant correlation between treatment and 
genomic characteristics with OS and PFS.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients with oPC were identified, among whom 38% were 
female. Eighty-seven percent were Caucasian, and 13% were other ethnicities 
(African American, Hispanic, and Asian). The median age was 66 years. Patients 
received gemcitabine (gem) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy. 
Eight-five percent of patients received chemotherapy within 3 months of SBRT and 
the median follow-up time of 16 months. The RR was 25% in the primary lesion and 
17% in metastatic lesions. SBRT to primary pancreas lesion correlated with 
higher OS [hazard ratio (HR): 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.082-0.89, 
P=0.03] but showed no difference in PFS (HR: 0.97, P=0.95) when compared to SBRT 
to any other metastatic site. SBRT to liver metastases had no improvement in OS 
(P=0.92) or PFS (P=0.70) versus SBRT to other metastatic sites. The type of 
chemotherapy (gem vs. 5-FU based) alongside SBRT within 3 months did not 
influence OS (P=0.47) or PFS (P=0.62) in these patients. Among 30 patients who 
underwent circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) testing, SMAD4 gene 
alteration correlated with significantly higher PFS (HR: 0.23, 95% CI: 
0.065-0.87, P=0.03) but had no relation with OS (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.18-2.03, 
P=0.41) compared to patients with undetectable SMAD4 alteration.
CONCLUSIONS: SBRT plus chemotherapy may have benefits in some patients with oPC. 
SBRT to primary pancreas lesion led to better OS compared with SBRT to other 
metastatic sites. SMAD4 alteration in ctDNA testing correlated with higher PFS 
in oPC patients who received SBRT. This implies a potential role for genomic 
biomarker-based patient selection in oPC. These findings are currently being 
studied in a randomized clinical trial evaluating SBRT plus chemotherapy in oPC 
(NCT04975516).

BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph nodes and lymph node metastases in patients with 
colorectal cancer (CRC) seriously affect prognosis. In order to improve the 
accuracy of lymph node assessment during surgery, it is crucial to explore 
advanced imaging techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value 
of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) versus indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence 
imaging for sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) and lymph node metastasis 
(LNM) in patients with CRC.
METHODS: A total of 120 patients with CRC admitted to our hospital from March 
2022 to December 2023 were included in this retrospective study and, according 
to the detection method, they were divided into ICG group (ICG fluorescence 
imaging group, n=50) and control group (EUS group, n=70). The general data of 
patients, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ICG imaging for the 
diagnosis of SLNM and LNM in patients with CRC were statistically compared 
between the two groups using gold standard postoperative pathology reports. Area 
under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the 
diagnostic value of ICG fluorescence imaging for SLNM and LNM in patients with 
CRC.
RESULTS: For diagnosing SLNM in CRC patients, ICG fluorescence imaging achieved 
sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies of 94.44%, 93.75%, and 94.00%, 
respectively, significantly outperforming EUS, which achieved sensitivities, 
specificities, and accuracies of 40.74%, 69.77%, and 58.58% respectively. For 
LNM diagnosis, ICG fluorescence imaging showed sensitivities, specificities, and 
accuracies of 80.00%, 92.5%, and 90.00%, compared to 28.57%, 71.43%, and 62.86% 
for EUS. The area under curve (AUC) of ICG for LNM in patients with CRC was 
0.932 with an optimal cut-off value of 0.77, achieving sensitivities and 
specificities of 95.45% and 81.82%.
CONCLUSIONS: In the assessment of SLNM and LNM in patients with CRC, ICG 
fluorescence imaging is proven to be more valuable than EUS.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize gut microbiome alterations in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) patients following cancer chemotherapy (CCT) and to explore associations 
with bacterial translocation and host miRNA dynamics.
METHODS: Stool samples were prospectively collected from 20 CRC patients who had 
undergone radical surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (CAPOX/mFOLFOX6). 
Stool samples were collected pre- and post-CCT. Microbial profiling was 
performed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Bacterial translocation was assessed by 
measuring serum anti-Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) IgA/IgG levels by ELISA. miRNA 
expression of miR-143 and miR-145 was quantified using qPCR.
RESULTS: Post-CCT samples showed significant increases in gut microbiome 
diversity (P<0.05), with higher relative abundances of Porphyromonas, 
Peptostreptococcus, and Parvimonas, and decreased abundances of Faecalibacterium 
and Ruminococcaceae (P<0.005). Network analysis identified Peptostreptococcus 
and Parvimonas as possible CRC-associated taxa. Serum anti-LPS IgA and IgG 
levels significantly declined post-CCT, indicating reduced bacterial 
translocation. Concurrently, miR-143 and miR-145 levels increased more than 
twofold post-CCT (P<0.01), positively correlating with microbial shifts.
CONCLUSION: CCT induces significant remodeling of CRC-associated gut microbiota, 
characterized by suppression of pathogenic genera and enrichment of 
pro-inflammatory taxa. These changes align with reduced bacterial translocation 
and increased expression of tumor-suppressive miRNAs, suggesting that CCT exerts 
dual therapeutic effects by simultaneously modulating microbial communities and 
host molecular pathways.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of adding cindilizumab to the 
Xeloda-Irinotecan (XELIRI) regimen in patients with advanced colorectal cancer 
and to identify clinical and molecular biomarkers predictive of treatment 
response.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 197 patients with advanced 
colorectal carcinoma treated between January 2019 and June 2023. Patients were 
divided into two cohorts: the standard treatment group receiving XELIRI alone 
(n=103) and the combined treatment group receiving XELIRI with cindilizumab 
(n=94). Treatment response was assessed according to RECIST criteria and 
classified as responsive (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or 
non-responsive (stable disease [SD] or progressive disease [PD]). Logistic 
regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of 
treatment response. Adverse events were recorded throughout the treatment 
course.
RESULTS: The experimental cohort demonstrated statistically higher objective 
response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) compared to the standard 
treatment cohort (ORR: 38.30% versus 22.33%, P=0.015; DCR: 80.85% versus 66.02%, 
P=0.019). The incidence of hypothyroidism and renal impairment was significantly 
higher in the combination group (P=0.002). Logistic regression identified 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (OR=1.336, P<0.001), tumor diameter (OR=2.818, 
P=0.001), KRAS/NRAS gene status (OR=6.229, P=0.001), and treatment regimen 
(OR=0.079, P<0.001) as independent predictors of treatment response. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that their combined 
prediction significantly improved predictive efficacy (AUC=0.881), with high 
sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: Cindilizumab combined with XELIRI regimen improves ORR and DCR in 
patients with advanced colorectal cancer but may increase the risk of 
hypothyroidism and renal impairment. CEA, tumor diameter, KRAS/NRAS gene, and 
treatment regimen are independent predictors of treatment response. The combined 
predictive model demonstrates robust diagnostic performance.

BOGO: A Proteome-Wide Gene Overexpression Platform for Discovering Rational 
Cancer Combination Therapies.

Cancer drug resistance remains a major barrier to durable treatment success, 
often leading to relapse despite advances in precision oncology. While 
combination therapies are being increasingly investigated, such as chemotherapy 
with small molecule inhibitors, predicting drug response and identifying 
rational drug combinations based on resistance mechanisms remain major 
challenges. Therefore, a proteome-wide, single-gene overexpression screening 
platform is essential for guiding rational therapy selection. Here, we present 
BOGO (Bxb1-landing pad human ORFeome-integrated system for a proteome-wide Gene 
Overexpression), a robust, scalable, and reproducible screening platform that 
enables single-copy, site-specific integration and overexpression of ~19,000 
human ORFs across cancer cell models. Using BOGO, we identified drug-specific 
response drivers for 16 chemotherapeutic agents and integrated clinical datasets 
to uncover proliferation and resistance-associated genes with prognostic 
potential. Drug response similarity networks revealed both shared and unique 
mechanisms, highlighting key pathways such as autophagy, apoptosis, and Wnt 
signaling, and notable resistance-associated genes including BCL2, POLD2, and 
TRADD. In particular, we proposed a synergistic combination of the BCL2 family 
inhibitor ABT-263 (Navitoclax) and the DNA analog TAS-102 (Lonsurf), which 
revealed that lysosomal modulation is a key mechanism driving DNA analog 
resistance. This combination therapy selectively enhanced cytotoxicity in 
colorectal and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, and demonstrated therapeutic 
benefit in vivo in both cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) models. Together, these findings establish BOGO as a powerful 
gene overexpression perturbation platform for systematically identifying 
chemoresistance and chemosensitization drivers, and for discovering rational 
combination therapies. Its scalability and reproducibility position BOGO as a 
broadly applicable tool for functional genomics and therapeutic discovery beyond 
cancer resistance.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) substantially alters the gastrointestinal microbiome from 
an early age, leading to significant changes in microbial composition and 
functionality. This study explores the physiological and microbiological factors 
contributing to dysbiosis in children with cystic fibrosis (cwCF), characterized 
by an increase in potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli and a decrease in 
beneficial anaerobes such as Bacteroides. In this study, we employed an in vitro 
medium representative of the nutritional environment of the CF colon to test the 
role of factors including mucin, fat, bile, pH, antibiotics and features 
associated with inflammation (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, formate, reactive oxygen 
species) on growth of clinical isolates of E. coli and Bacteroides spp. We 
further examined interactions between these two microbes under CF-like 
conditions to understand modulators of microbial competition, and identified 
glycerol, a surrogate of increased fat, as a significant driver of altered 
microbial competition. Finally, we investigated genetic determinants influencing 
these microbial interactions, with the focus on glycerol metabolism, by 
performing a transposon mutagenesis screen in E. coli. Results of this screen 
pointed to the role of colibactin production in mediating this microbial 
competition; colibactin is a DNA-damaging genotoxin associated with the 
increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in CF populations. This work enhances 
our understanding of mechanisms of microbial competition in the CF gut, while 
potentially enhancing our understanding of colorectal cancer risk in persons 
with CF through the identification of early-life microbial biomarkers.

The Gene Encoding Ornithine Decarboxylase for Putrescine Biosynthesis Is 
Essential for the Viability of Fusobacterium nucleatum.

Xu S, G C B, Phan A, Wu C.

Fusobacterium nucleatum is a Gram-negative anaerobe associated with 
periodontitis and colorectal cancer. It secretes putrescine, a polyamine that 
promotes biofilm formation by oral co-colonizers and enhances the proliferation 
of cancer cells. However, the physiological importance of putrescine for F. 
nucleatum itself remains unexplored. Here, we show that putrescine biosynthesis, 
mediated by the ornithine decarboxylase gene oda , is essential for F. nucleatum 
viability. Deletion of oda was only possible when a functional copy was provided 
in trans, and CRISPR interference of oda expression resulted in complete growth 
arrest. The essentiality of oda was conserved across multiple subspecies. 
Supplementation with exogenous putrescine enabled the isolation of a conditional 
oda mutant whose growth was strictly putrescine-dependent. Putrescine depletion 
caused filamentation, membrane disruption, detergent hypersensitivity, and lysis 
in hypoosmotic conditions, indicating a critical role in maintaining cell 
envelope integrity. RNA sequencing revealed broad transcriptional remodeling 
under putrescine-limited conditions, including upregulation of genes involved in 
lipid metabolism, osmoprotection, and cell wall remodeling. Notably, oda 
transcript levels increased when putrescine was depleted, suggesting a negative 
feedback mechanism. These findings demonstrate that putrescine is not only an 
extracellular communal metabolite but is also vital for the cellular integrity 
and survival of F. nucleatum under anaerobic conditions.
IMPORTANCE: Fusobacterium nucleatum is a prominent member of the oral microbiota 
and has been linked to various human diseases, including periodontitis, preterm 
birth, and colorectal cancer. Despite its clinical significance, the metabolic 
requirements that support its growth and viability remain poorly understood. In 
this study, we identify the oda gene, which encodes ornithine decarboxylase, as 
essential for F. nucleatum survival due to its role in putrescine biosynthesis. 
We demonstrate that depletion of putrescine leads to severe growth and 
morphological defects, accompanied by widespread transcriptional changes. These 
findings reveal an underappreciated metabolic vulnerability and highlight the 
critical role of polyamine homeostasis in maintaining cellular integrity in this 
notorious anaerobe.

Colorectal cancer (CRC), which has high mortality and increasing morbidity is a 
major concern worldwide. The autophagy pathway plays a crucial role in 
carcinogenesis and drug resistance in this disease. Epigenetic modification is 
one of the main regulatory mechanisms for this pathway. This study aimed to 
investigate the impact of promoter methylation as one of the epigenetic 
modifications on the expression of autophagy-associated genes (ATGs) (ATG2B, 
ATG4D, ATG9A, and ATG9B) in 21 CRC patients from southern Iran. The tissue DNA 
and RNA were extracted by standard phenol-chloroform extraction method and A 
BIOZOL RNA isolation kit, respectively. The methylation status and transcript 
levels of desired genes were ascertained using the methylation-specific PCR and 
quantitative real-time PCR methods, respectively. In the majority of studied 
patients, the relative mRNA expressions of ATGs were significantly higher in CRC 
tissues compared to normal ones. There was no significant relationship between 
the methylation of the ATG genes and clinicopathological features of CRC 
patients. Interestingly, in most of the patients, the promoter hypermethylation 
of the ATG2B, ATG4D, ATG9A and ATG9B genes led to their high mRNA expression. 
Although promoter hypermethylation usually suppresses gene expression, the 
cancer type, stage, and compensatory mechanisms may reverse this association. 
This highlights the complexity of the epigenetic regulation of ATG2B, ATG4D, 
ATG9A and ATG9B genes in CRC. Further large-scale studies will contribute to 
discovering the exact influences of ATG methylation in CRC carcinogenesis and 
thereby may thereby provide novel targets and biomarkers for this lethal 
illness.

University Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) emerged due to genetic mutations that fuel tumor 
development and influence patient outcomes. This research investigates KRAS, 
BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in Iraqi Kurdish patients to assess their biological 
relevance and impact on clinical outcomes. Clinical and pathological data were 
collected from 150 patients' medical profiles. DNA was extracted from FFPE 
samples for KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation analysis. Variations in KRAS and 
BRAF 600/601 were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification 
followed by hybridization assays. Real-time PCR was utilized to detect PIK3CA 
mutations. Tumors were predominantly located in the colon (80%) and classified 
as adenocarcinomas (88%), with stage III being the most frequent (36%). 
Metastases were observed in 72.67% of cases, primarily in the liver (46.67%). 
KRAS mutations were identified in 37.33% of cases (mainly in codons 12 and 13), 
while BRAF V600E mutations occurred in 10.67%, and PIK3CA mutations were 
detected in 18.67%, with exon 9 alterations more common than those in exon 20. 
KRAS mutations were strongly associated with liver metastases (p=0.006), and 
BRAF mutations correlated with peritoneal metastases (p=0.0001). Co-mutations of 
KRAS and PIK3CA appeared in 7.33% of cases, while BRAF and PIK3CA co-mutations 
were rarer (1.3%). Our study underscores the complexity of CRC and the pivotal 
role of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA variations in tumor progression and outcomes in 
Iraq's Kurdistan Region, highlighting the importance of molecular profiling in 
clinical care.

INTRODUCTION: Healthy habits such as regular physical activity, a balanced diet 
and tobacco abstinence are associated with better health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) in cancer survivors. However, there is limited evidence on this 
relationship in Latin American countries, where socioeconomic and cultural 
factors may influence adherence to healthy behaviours.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between adherence to healthy lifestyle 
recommendations and HRQoL in cancer survivors in Uruguay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 241 
early-stage cancer survivors treated at two hospitals in Uruguay. Adherence to 
healthy habits was assessed using a questionnaire based on the American Cancer 
Society recommendations. HRQoL was measured using the RAND-36 questionnaire. 
Categorical variables were analysed using the chi-square test, while continuous 
variables were analysed using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test. The 
correlation between SF-36 dimensions and healthy habits was assessed using 
Spearman's coefficient.
RESULTS: The median age was 66.7 years and 55.2% were women. The most common 
cancers were breast (31.1%), colorectal (28.2%) and prostate (26.6%). A total of 
62.7% of participants adhered to three or more healthy habits. Adherent patients 
showed significantly higher HRQoL scores, particularly in physical function 
(62.68 versus 45.67, p < 0.001), energy/fatigue (64.83 versus 45.89, p < 0.001) 
and emotional well-being (69.43 versus 53.02, p < 0.001). Adherence to multiple 
healthy habits was significantly correlated with improvements in physical and 
mental domains, with energy/fatigue showing the strongest correlation (rs = 
0.66, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Adherence to healthy habits has a cumulative positive impact on the 
HRQoL of cancer survivors. This study highlights the need to design 
comprehensive interventions to promote healthy behaviours in this population, 
contributing to the global evidence on cancer care and underscoring its 
importance in developing countries.

The integration of AI chatbots in healthcare, particularly for young adults 
diagnosed with gastric cancer, offers a novel approach to enhancing patient 
support and information access. This evaluation examines the effectiveness of 
two AI chatbots, Sider Fusion AI Bot, and Perplexity AI, in improving patient 
outcomes, alleviating anxiety, and promoting informed decision-making. A 
comparative study design was employed, utilizing a structured rubric guided by 
experienced gastroenterologists to assess the performance of both chatbots. 
Evaluation criteria included competency, accuracy, relevance, informativeness, 
and support capabilities. The study focused on a case involving a 21-year-old 
male with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Both chatbots demonstrated high 
competency and relevance scores, achieving perfect scores of 5. However, they 
received low accuracy scores of 1, indicating a need for scrutiny in specific 
details. Sider Fusion AI Bot excelled in informativeness (score of 5) and 
support capabilities (rated "high"), while Perplexity AI scored 4 in 
informativeness and was rated "moderate" for support. Both systems provided 
essential recommendations for alleviating anxiety and emphasized informed 
decision-making, but Sider Fusion AI Bot offered a more comprehensive discharge 
plan. The study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of AI chatbots in 
oncology, emphasizing the importance of tailored communication styles to enhance 
patient engagement and outcomes. Sider Fusion AI Bot's superior capacity for 
detailed explanations and user engagement positions it as a potentially more 
valuable tool in clinical decision-making. Ongoing research is necessary to 
address limitations and optimize the integration of AI chatbots in healthcare 
settings, ensuring they effectively complement human interactions.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) with liver metastasis remains a significant 
therapeutic challenge, particularly in cases of postoperative recurrence. While 
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and targeted therapies have shown promise 
individually, the efficacy combining these for treating postoperative recurrent 
CRC with liver metastasis requires further investigation.
AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with targeted 
therapies for postoperative recurrent CRC with liver metastasis.
METHODS: This observational study enrolled 75 patients with postoperative 
recurrent CRC accompanied by liver metastasis between January 2020 and December 
2023. All patients received combined treatment with TACE and targeted therapy: 
Bevacizumab (40 patients, 53.3%), cetuximab (25 patients, 33.3%), or panitumumab 
(10 patients, 13.3%). Treatment response was evaluated using the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria, with overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival as the primary endpoints. Quality of life was assessed 
using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of 
life questionnaire at baseline and after six months of treatment.
RESULTS: The median OS was 28 months (95% confidence interval: 24-32 months), 
and the median progression-free survival was 12 months (95% confidence interval: 
10-14 months). Patients treated with bevacizumab showed significantly better 
survival outcomes than those treated with cetuximab/panitumumab (median OS, 30 
vs 24 months, P = 0.015). The overall response rate was 58.7%, with a disease 
control rate of 86.7%. Quality of life scores improved significantly across all 
domains, with greater improvements observed in the bevacizumab group. 
Treatment-related adverse events were manageable, with grade 3-4 events 
occurring in 13.3% of the patients and no treatment-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: The combination of TACE with targeted therapy, particularly 
bevacizumab, has demonstrated promising efficacy and acceptable safety for the 
treatment of postoperative recurrent CRC with liver metastasis. This multimodal 
approach not only improved survival outcomes but also enhanced the patients' 
quality of life, suggesting its potential as a valuable treatment strategy for 
this challenging condition.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers globally, with a 
high recurrence rate following curative surgery, especially within the first 3 
to 5 years. Post-surgical follow-up plays a vital role in detecting local and 
distant recurrences, significantly influencing survival rates. However, despite 
established guidelines recommending surveillance strategies, discrepancies 
persist regarding the optimal surveillance modality and patient adherence to 
follow protocols. Sala-Miquel et al's study emphasize the superiority of 
computed tomography in detecting metastasis and recurrence, while also shedding 
light on the critical role of adherence to surveillance protocols in improving 
patient outcomes. This editorial discusses the implications of these findings 
for clinical practice, providing a comprehensive overview of the current 
landscape of CRC surveillance and the path forward for improving patient 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: To observe the endoscopic and pathological characteristics of 
laterally spreading tumors (LSTs) and explore the risk factors for 
carcinogenesis and submucosal infiltration.
AIM: To analyze the clinicopathological features of colorectal LSTs treated 
endoscopically and determine risk factors associated with carcinogenesis and 
submucosal invasion, providing evidence-based guidance for optimal treatment 
strategy selection.
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the sex, age, and endoscopic and 
pathological features of patients who underwent endoscopic treatment for 
colorectal LSTs in our hospital from January 2021 to July 2024. Single-factor 
analysis was used to identify the risk factors for cancer and submucosal 
infiltration, and the factors with statistical significance were included in 
multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 422 patients, including 224 males and 198 females, aged 
63.45 ± 9.23 years, were included. There were 456 LST lesions in total. The 
length of the endoscopically resected specimens was 3.01 ± 0.48 cm, and the 
length of the lesions was 2.37 ± 1.59 cm. It was located in 115 rectums (25.2%), 
40 sigmoid colon (8.8%), 26 descending colon (5.7%), 109 transverse colon 
(23.9%), 112 ascending colon (24.6%), and 54 ileocecal regions (11.8%). 
Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed in 237 patients (52.0%), 
and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was performed in 95 patients (20.8%). 
There were 113 EMR with precutting cases (24.8%), 11 ESD with snare cases 
(2.4%), 4 delayed bleeding cases and 5 intraoperative perforations. The 
pathological results revealed 119 cases of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia 
(26.1%), 221 cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (48.5%), 82 cases of 
intramucosal carcinoma (18.0%), and 34 cases of submucous invasive carcinoma 
(7.5%). Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that lesion size ( > 2 
cm), lesion location (rectal) and endoscopic classification [false depressed 
tubulovillous adenoma (LST-NG pseudodepressed type, LST-NG-PD), type 1 particles 
(LST-G homogenous type), and LST-G nodular mixed type], accompanied by large 
nodules (with) were independent risk factors for carcinogenesis; endoscopic 
classification (LST-NG-PD) and the presence of large nodules were independent 
risk factors for submucosal infiltration.
CONCLUSION: These risk factors provide practical guidance for treatment 
selection: LST-NG-PD with large nodules should prioritize ESD, while high-risk 
rectal lesions > 2 cm may require additional imaging evaluation before 
endoscopic resection.

inflammatory profiles in colorectal cancer (CRC). Analyzing 56 patients, the 
study reveals that MSI-high tumors are associated with significantly lower serum 
albumin, body mass index, and absolute lymphocyte counts, alongside elevated 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios compared to microsatellite stable tumors. These 
findings highlight distinct immunological and nutritional profiles in MSI-high 
CRC, suggesting potential clinical utility in risk stratification and 
personalized treatment. While the study underscores the importance of MSI status 
in CRC management, its single-center design and limited sample size warrant 
validation through multicenter trials. This article contextualizes these 
findings within the broader landscape of CRC research, emphasizing the need for 
integrating biomarker-driven strategies into clinical practice to optimize 
outcomes for patients with differing MSI statuses.

BACKGROUND: The diagnostic accuracy for detecting metastatic lymph nodes in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) remains suboptimal. To address this limitation, our 
study investigates the potential of gemstone spectral computed tomography 
imaging (GSI) to improve diagnostic accuracy in lymph node metastasis (LNM) 
assessment.
AIM: To extensively investigate the clinical utility of GSI in the preoperative 
assessment of CRC.
METHODS: The subject population included 200 patients with CRC who were admitted 
to Zibo Central Hospital from January 2022 to December 2023. All patients 
underwent dual-phase contrast-enhanced scans in the arterial and venous phases 
using GSI before surgical intervention. During the research, meticulous 
quantification was conducted regarding the number of patients with CRC with LNM 
as well as the exact count of metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, for both 
metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes, the short diameter at the maximum 
cross-sectional area (covering the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes), 
morphological features (including manifestations such as margin blurring, 
aggregation, and enhancement), and spectral parameters in the arterial and 
venous phases [specifically iodine concentration (IC), normalized IC (NIC), and 
the slope of the spectral curve (λHU)] were measured and recorded, and a 
comparative analysis was conducted. The diagnostic efficacy of each index with 
differences was systematically assessed using the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve. Concurrently, receiver operating characteristic 
curves were constructed for LNM screening based on the short diameter at the 
maximum cross-sectional area of lymph nodes and each spectral parameter in the 
arterial and venous phases.
RESULTS: The area under the curve of GSI for diagnosing LNM in patients with CRC 
can reach 0.897, with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 92.59%, 85.87%, 
and 89.50%, respectively. A total of 265 lymph nodes were analyzed from the 200 
participants with CRC, with metastatic lymph nodes accounting for 56.60%. 
Compared with non-metastatic lymph nodes, the short diameters of metastatic 
lymph nodes in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes were significantly 
increased, whereas the IC values in the arterial and venous phases, the NIC 
value in the arterial phase, and the λHU values in the arterial and venous 
phases were significantly decreased. The short axial, sagittal, and coronal 
diameters, arterial-phase IC, venous-phase IC, arterial-phase NIC, 
arterial-phase λHU, and venous-phase λHU for diagnosing metastatic lymph nodes 
demonstrated area under the curve values of 0.631, 0.681, 0.659, 0.862, 0.808, 
0.831, 0.801, and 0.706, respectively.
CONCLUSION: GSI exhibits substantial clinical significance in the preoperative 
assessment of CRC. Among the parameters assessed, the arterial-phase IC 
demonstrates the most outstanding diagnostic performance, effectively improving 
the diagnostic efficacy for preoperative LNM in CRC.

BACKGROUND: Recently, intestinal stenting combined with laparoscopic surgery has 
received increasing attention as a treatment option for acute intestinal 
obstruction. However, its safety and efficacy have not yet been established.
AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of combining intestinal stenting with 
laparoscopic surgery for the management of acute intestinal obstruction.
METHODS: Clinical data from 74 patients with colorectal cancer and acute 
intestinal obstruction, who were admitted to the emergency department of the 
authors' hospital between October 2023 and November 2024, were collected and 
analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the surgical 
intervention: A control group (emergency open surgery, n = 37) and a study group 
(intestinal stent implantation combined with laparoscopic surgery, n = 37). 
Observation indicators included stent placement rate, obstruction relief rate, 
and stent-related complications.
RESULTS: Intestinal stent placement was 100% successful in the study group, all 
of whom experienced relief from obstruction while exhibiting a significantly 
lower rate of ostomy creation and a higher rate of primary anastomosis than in 
the control group, as well as less intraoperative blood loss, shorter time to 
flatus, and shorter hospital stay. The complication rate was 5.41% (2/37; 
bleeding and re-obstruction), with no statistically significant difference 
between the two groups in terms of operative duration or perioperative 
mortality. The overall complication rates were 5.41% (2/37) and 21.62% (8/37) in 
the intervention and control groups, respectively. Tumor recurrence and overall 
survival rates were 2.70% and 97.30% in the study group and 13.51% and 91.89% in 
the control group, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Intestinal stenting relieved acute obstructions, reduced the number 
of emergency surgeries, and supported laparoscopic procedures while improving 
primary anastomosis rates, minimizing ostomy occurrence, surgical trauma, and 
complications, and accelerating recovery.

BACKGROUND: KRAS mutation status and primary tumor location serve as critical 
prognostic factors for colorectal liver metastases (CLMs). Emerging evidence 
suggests a potential interaction between these two variables that may influence 
clinical outcomes.
AIM: To investigate the association of KRAS mutations with recurrence in 
patients with CLM who underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) according to the 
primary tumor location.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 164 patients with KRAS-determined CLM 
treated with percutaneous RFA between January 2012 and December 2018. The 
clinicopathological characteristics, recurrence patterns, and survival outcomes 
were systematically evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 164 patients (mean age: 58.0 ± 9.8 years, range: 34-83 
years) who underwent percutaneous RFA of 325 CLMs (mean size: 2.2 ± 1.0 cm, 
range: 0.7-5.0 cm) were included in the study. Eighty-nine (54.3%) patients had 
wild-type KRAS, and 75 (45.7%) patients had mutated KRAS. Compared with 
wild-type patients, patients with KRAS mutations presented significantly higher 
local tumor progression rates (30.7% vs 14.6%, P = 0.013). Among 126 patients 
(76.8%) who experienced post-RFA recurrence, 61.6% developed intrahepatic 
metastases, and 53.7% developed extrahepatic metastases. Primary tumor location 
significantly modified KRAS-related outcomes: Compared with wild-type patients, 
left-sided colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with KRAS mutations presented higher 
intrahepatic recurrence rates (77.2% vs 52.5%, P = 0.003) and shorter median 
intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (15 vs 25 months, P = 0.007). No 
significant differences in KRAS expression were detected in right-sided tumors.
CONCLUSION: KRAS mutation status predicts differential recurrence patterns after 
CLM ablation, with significant prognostic implications, specifically in 
left-sided CRCs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating 
molecular profiling and primary tumor characteristics in therapeutic 
decision-making for patients with metastatic CRC.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal polyps (CPs) are important precursor lesions of 
colorectal cancer, and endoscopic surgery remains the primary treatment option. 
However, the short-term recurrence rate post-surgery is high, and the risk 
factors for recurrence remain unknown.
AIM: To comprehensively explore risk factors for short-term recurrence of CPs 
after endoscopic surgery and develop a nomogram prediction model.
METHODS: Overall, 362 patients who underwent endoscopic polypectomy between 
January 2022 and January 2024 at Nanjing Jiangbei Hospital were included. We 
screened basic demographic data, clinical and polyp characteristics, 
surgery-related information, and independent risk factors for CPs recurrence 
using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The multivariate 
analysis results were used to construct a nomogram prediction model, internally 
validated using Bootstrapping, with performance evaluated using area under the 
curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis.
RESULTS: CP re-occurred in 166 (45.86%) of the 362 patients within 1 year 
post-surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR = 
1.04, P = 0.002), alcohol consumption (OR = 2.07, P = 0.012), Helicobacter 
pylori infection (OR = 2.34, P < 0.001), polyp number > 2 (OR = 1.98, P = 
0.005), sessile polyps (OR = 2.10, P = 0.006), and adenomatous pathological type 
(OR = 3.02, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for post-surgery 
recurrence. The nomogram prediction model showed good discriminatory (AUC = 
0.73) and calibrating power, and decision curve analysis showed that the model 
had good clinical benefit at risk probabilities > 20%.
CONCLUSION: We identified multiple independent risk factors for short-term 
recurrence after endoscopic surgery. The nomogram prediction model showed a 
certain degree of differentiation, calibration, and potential clinical 
applicability.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy worldwide and the 
second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Its global incidence increases 
annually, with most patients diagnosed at advanced stages. Despite substantial 
advancements in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune therapy, and targeted 
therapy, surgical treatment remains the mainstay for CRC management. 
Particularly, surgery is most effective for managing early-stage and locally 
advanced cancers. CRC surgery has evolved from conventional subtractive surgery 
to modern minimally invasive and precision-based techniques. Additionally, CRC 
treatment strategies have expanded from a single surgical therapy to a 
multi-modal integrated system encompassing endoscopic therapy, perioperative 
therapy, molecular targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. This review elucidates 
the evolution of CRC surgical treatment, describing its transition from early 
palliative surgery to radical surgery, and, finally, to functional surgery, 
minimally invasive surgical techniques, and personalized treatment. It reflects 
the transformation in CRC treatment from simplistic to complex, from generalized 
to precise, and from singular to comprehensive techniques, providing a holistic 
perspective on advancements in CRC surgical treatment.

BACKGROUND: Patients with uremia undergoing colorectal cancer surgery face an 
increased risk of postoperative complications due to impaired renal function, 
challenges in fluid balance, and the complexities of anesthetic management. 
Effective anesthesia and fluid strategies are critical to reducing complications 
and improving outcomes. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and goal-directed 
fluid therapy (GDT) have been suggested to enhance perioperative stability 
compared with inhalational anesthesia and standard fluid therapy. However, 
evidence supporting their efficacy in patients with uremia remains limited.
AIM: To evaluate the effects of different anesthetic techniques on postoperative 
complications in patients with uremia undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 120 patients with stage 3-5 
uremia who underwent elective colorectal cancer surgery between January 2022 and 
December 2024. Patients received either inhalational anesthesia or TIVA, 
combined with either standard fluid therapy or GDT. The primary outcome measure 
was the incidence of postoperative complications. Secondary outcomes included 
length of hospital stay, major complications, and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: Postoperative complications occurred in 23.3% (28/120) of patients. 
TIVA was associated with a lower complication rate than that of inhalational 
anesthesia (20.0% vs 26.7%, P = 0.045). GDT resulted in significantly reduced 
fluid administration (2400 mL vs 3100 mL, P < 0.001) and lower complication 
rates (19.5% vs 28.2%, P = 0.030) compared with those of standard management. 
Independent risk factors for complications included age over 75 years (OR: 2.40, 
95%CI: 1.60-3.60), stage 5 uremia (OR: 1.85, 95%CI: 1.20-2.85), and cumulative 
fluid balance exceeding 2000 mL (OR: 1.70, 95%CI: 1.10-2.65). Patients with 
complications had longer hospital stays (median, 15 days vs 11 days; P < 0.001) 
and higher rates of major complications (27.8% vs 13.5%; P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: In patients with uremia undergoing colorectal cancer surgery, TIVA 
and GDT are associated with a lower incidence of postoperative complications 
compared with that of inhalational anesthesia and standard fluid management. 
Optimizing anesthetic techniques and fluid management may improve postoperative 
outcomes in this high-risk population.

Medical College Affiliated Shulan (Hangzhou) Hospital, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang 
Province, China. suqin.huang@shulan.com.

BACKGROUND: The use of an ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block (QLB) 
combined with general anesthesia for patients undergoing colorectal cancer 
surgery serves as a model for reducing the postoperative stress response, 
preserving metabolic stability, protecting renal function, and alleviating 
postoperative pain.
AIM: To compare QLB combined with general anesthesia vs general anesthesia alone 
in the perioperative stress response, metabolic and renal function, 
postoperative pain, and recovery outcomes among patients undergoing colorectal 
cancer surgery.
METHODS: Clinical data of 116 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery 
at our hospital between July 2023 and August 2024 were collected for 
retrospective analysis. According to the anesthesia protocol, the patients were 
divided into the control (general anesthesia, n = 58) and experimental groups 
(QLB combined with general anesthesia, n = 58). Physiological indicators such as 
blood glucose (GLU), lactic acid (LAC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and 
creatinine (CRE) were measured at T0 (pre-surgery), T1 (post-surgery), T2 (6 
hours post-surgery), T3 (24 hours post-surgery), and T4 (48 hours post-surgery). 
The differences between the two groups for each indicator were evaluated using 
repeated-measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS: The GLU levels from T1 to T4 in the experimental group were 
significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.001), and the LAC 
levels were also significantly reduced (P < 0.001). The experimental group 
exhibited superior renal protection based on postoperative BUN and CRE levels (P 
< 0.05). Furthermore, the postoperative pain score in the experimental group was 
significantly lower than that in the control group [visual analogue scale (VAS)] 
scores differed significantly from T2 to T4, P < 0.05.
CONCLUSION: Research has shown that QLB combined with general anesthesia can 
decrease postoperative GLU and LAC by 8%-15% and 10%-20% (P < 0.001), 
respectively. It also enhances renal function markers (BUN, CRE, P < 0.05) and 
lowers VAS scores by 15%-30% (P < 0.05). Ultrasound-guided lumbar muscle block 
with general anesthesia outperforms general anesthesia alone in diminishing 
stress response, preserving metabolic balance and renal function, and 
alleviating postoperative pain. This approach offers a more efficient 
perioperative management strategy for patients undergoing colorectal cancer 
surgery. It is particularly advantageous for individuals with stress 
sensitivity, renal impairment, and heightened pain susceptibility.

BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin (OXL) is a key treatment for colorectal cancer but can 
potentially induce type II hypersensitivity reactions (II-HSRs), leading to 
immune-mediated cytopenias. The prevalence and management of OXL-induced II-HSRs 
remain poorly understood, with evidence being mainly anecdotal and lacking a 
systematic approach. This study examines the prevalence, clinical presentation, 
diagnosis, and management of OXL-induced II-HSRs in our population.
METHODS: We prospectively analysed a cohort of OXL-reactive patients at our Drug 
Hypersensitivity and Desensitisation Centre between January 2019 and April 2024. 
Patients with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of II-HSR were 
included and classified into acute immune thrombocytopenia (AIT), immune 
haemolytic anaemia (IHA), Evans syndrome (ES), or drug-induced thrombotic 
microangiopathy (DITMA). Drug-dependent antibodies (DDAbs) were detected via 
flow cytometry. Carefully selected patients underwent re-exposure to OXL under 
allergy care and special safety measures.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients were diagnosed with II-HSRs, with a prevalence of 9.5% 
among OXL-reactive patients. The mean number of OXL cycles at onset was 20. 
Atypical hypersensitivity symptoms such as chills, fever, and back pain aided 
clinical identification. AIT was the most common presentation (56%), followed by 
ES (38%), and one case of DITMA (6%). DDAbs were detected in 86% of cases, with 
two patients showing DDAbs to other drugs. Five selected patients were 
re-exposed to OXL without significant complications.
CONCLUSION: OXL-induced II-HSRs are rare but pose diagnostic and management 
challenges. This study shows the importance of early identification, the 
potential role of DDAbs testing, and the feasibility of re-exposure under 
controlled conditions in selected patients.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and aggressive malignancy of the 
gastrointestinal tract with a severe disease burden. The role of Traditional 
Chinese Medicine (TCM) and its natural active ingredients in enhancing the 
therapeutic effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and preventing the 
recurrence and metastasis of CRC has been increasingly recognized. Herba 
Patriniae has shown significant clinical efficacy for the treatment of CRC. 
Flavonoids has been found to be one of the main active anticancer components of 
Herba Patriniae. This review summarizes the latest findings from clinical trials 
and in vitro studies on anticancer mechanisms of Herba Patriniae, and discusses 
the role of the flavonoids in combination therapy against CRC. These flavonoids 
exert anticancer effects through diverse mechanisms. For instance, they prevent 
the development of precancerous lesions, regulate the cell cycle, modulate CRC 
cell proliferation, promote tumor cell apoptosis, inhibite 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reverse drug resistance, and modulate gut 
microbiota by acting on several key signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, 
Wnt/β-catenin, and EGFR/ERK/MAPK. Future research should prioritize clarifying 
the specific dosage and safety of flavonoids under different pathological 
conditions, further conducting large-scale, rigorously designed clinical studies 
to determine the efficacy differences of flavonoids for patients with different 
pathological types of CRC and simultaneously delving into the mechanisms of 
their anti-colorectal cancer effects, as well as their interactions with the 
intestinal microbiota and tumor microenvironment.

Oncogenic KRAS mutations are frequent in colorectal cancer, presenting 
substantial challenges due to constitutive activation and resistance to 
molecular-targeted therapies driven by mutation-specific biochemical properties. 
In this study, using single-molecule imaging, we quantitatively analyzed 
diffusional behaviors of oncogenic KRAS mutants and associated signaling 
molecules to elucidate their signaling mechanisms and therapeutic implications. 
Upon EGF stimulation, KRAS molecules exhibited transient trapping and reduced 
diffusion due to interactions with SOS1 and BRAF, leading to the temporary 
formation of signaling complexes. Our results demonstrate that analysis of the 
temporal fraction and frequency of transient trapping events offers a more 
sensitive and precise evaluation of KRAS activation levels than western 
blotting. Furthermore, the study of dynamics of individual oncogenic KRAS 
molecules provides a more accurate assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of 
various molecular-targeted drugs. Consequently, we propose a highly sensitive 
strategy to enhance the therapeutic targeting of oncogenic KRAS in living 
colorectal cancer cells.

The growing evidence ascertaining the overexpression of EGFR and HDAC1 in breast 
and colorectal cancers prompted us to design and synthesize some new 
coumarin-thiazole derivatives with dual EGFR/HDAC1 inhibitory activity, 
considering the nature of EGFR and HDAC inhibitory models. The new derivatives 
were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against HCT-116 and MCF-7 cancer 
cells along with BJ-1 normal cells. Compound 
3-(-1-((-5-(-(4-bromophenyl)diazenyl)-4-methylthiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)hydrazono)ethyl)-4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one 
(3m) showed promising selectivity indices for both cell lines, preferential 
inhibition of EGFR/HDAC1/ERK, induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and 
significant in vivo antitumor activity against Ehrlich ascites and solid 
carcinoma models. Docking study showed that the selected compound attained 
promising results within the active sites of EGFR and HDAC1.

INTRODUCTION: Hyperactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway serves as a central 
mechanism underlying tumor progression, immune evasion, and resistance to immune 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). A pivotal contributor 
to this process is the binding of β-catenin to B-cell lymphoma 9 (BCL9), which 
promotes transcription of oncogenes and fosters an immune-suppressive tumor 
milieu. Consequently, targeting this interaction offers a promising approach to 
suppress tumor progression and potentiate antitumor immune responses.
METHODS: We developed a peptide-based prodrug, Bcl9@TP, designed to 
competitively bind the BCL9 interface on β-catenin, destabilize the 
transcriptional complex, and suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Its antitumor 
efficacy and immune potentiation were assessed in vitro using MC38 cells and in 
vivo in murine tumor models.
RESULTS: In vitro, Bcl9@TP significantly inhibited MC38 cell proliferation by 
downregulating β-catenin and its downstream targets, inducing G1-phase cell 
cycle arrest. In vivo, Bcl9@TP treatment markedly reduced tumor burden, with a 
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rate of ~62%, significantly higher than the 
control group. In contrast, anti-PD-1 monotherapy yielded a TGI of only 41%. 
Notably, combination therapy (Bcl9@TP plus anti-PD-1) produced a more pronounced 
antitumor effect, with the TGI reaching 82%. Importantly, Bcl9@TP demonstrated 
favorable systemic biocompatibility and safety.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that disrupting the β-catenin/BCL9 interaction 
with a peptide-based nanoprodrug represents a compelling strategy to suppress 
oncogenic signaling and enhance immunotherapy responses in CRC, providing a new 
angle to boost checkpoint sensitivity.

Epigenetic modifications, particularly RNA methylation, play a crucial role in 
cancer progression, and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA 
modification in eukaryotes. Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), a key 
component of the m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC), regulates m6A 
modification, influencing RNA stability, translation, and degradation. WTAP 
dysregulation has been implicated in various malignancies, with particularly 
significant roles observed across the digestive system cancers, including but 
not limited to esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, hepatocellular, and 
colorectal carcinomas. Overexpression of WTAP is frequently associated with poor 
prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and increased metastatic potential. This 
review highlights the multifaceted roles and regulatory network of WTAP in 
digestive system cancers (DSCs) progression, encompassing tumor cell 
proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and immune evasion. 
Targeting WTAP may offer novel therapeutic strategies for overcoming therapy 
resistance and improving clinical outcomes in digestive system malignancies. 
Future research should prioritize: (1) validation of these findings in larger, 
multicenter, and ethnically diverse patient cohorts; (2) comprehensive 
elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying WTAP-mediated regulation in 
cancer biology; and (3) systematic exploration of its functional consequences in 
tumor progression and therapy resistance.

Butyrate may reduce risk of colorectal cancer and can be delivered to the colon 
using butyrylated starch (HAMSB). This trial evaluated effects of HAMSB on polyp 
burden in participants with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. The study was a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. In three-6-month 
periods participants ingested 40 g/day of HAMSB or low amylose starch, followed 
by the alternative, and then a washout. Participants underwent 4 video-recorded 
colonoscopies to assess polyp burden as the primary endpoint. At baseline two 
distal bowel tattoos were placed: tattoo one where polyps were cleared at each 
scope; tattoo two where polyps were left in situ. Generalized linear mixed 
models were used to estimate the ratio of mean polyp counts in intervention 
compared to placebo periods. 72 participants were randomized (33 female) with 49 
completing the study. In the intention-to-treat analysis HAMSB did not reduce 
mean global (0.9-fold change, 95% CI: 0.77-1.06, P=0.218) or small (<2.4 mm) 
polyp numbers (0.88-fold change, 95% CI: 0.71-1.1, P = 0.267). There was a trend 
for reduction of small polyps in tattoo one (0.72-fold change, 95% CI: 0.5-1.03, 
P=0.074). In the per-protocol analysis there was a strong trend for HAMSB to 
reduce mean global small polyp numbers (0.79-fold change, 0.62-1, P=0.051). 
HAMSB may reduce polyp initiation in the distal bowel without causing regression 
or growth of existing polyps. However, the 95% CI indicate large uncertainty to 
the true direction of the treatment effect and the P values provide only weak 
evidence against the null hypothesis of no treatment effect.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related 
morbidity and mortality. Accurate differentiation of tumor grade is crucial for 
prognosis and treatment planning. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic 
value of dual-source CT dual-energy technology parameters in distinguishing CRC 
differentiation grades.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 87 surgically and 
pathologically confirmed CRC patients (64 with medium-high differentiation and 
23 with low differentiation) who underwent dual-source CT dual-energy 
enhancement scanning. Normalized iodine concentration (NIC), spectral curve 
slope (K), and dual-energy index (DEI) of the tumor center were measured in 
arterial and venous phases. Differences in these parameters between 
differentiation groups were compared, and ROC curve analysis was performed to 
assess diagnostic efficacy.
RESULTS: The low-differentiation group exhibited significantly higher NIC, K, 
and DEI values in both arterial and venous phases compared to the mediumhigh 
differentiation group (P < 0.01). In the arterial phase, NIC, K, and DEI yielded 
AUC values of 0.920, 0.770, and 0.903, respectively, with sensitivities of 
95.7%, 65.2%, and 91.3%, and specificities of 82.8%, 75.0%, and 75.0%, 
respectively. In the venous phase, AUC values were 0.874, 0.837, and 0.886, with 
sensitivities of 91.3%, 82.6%, and 91.3%, and specificities of 68.75%, 75.0%, 
and 73.4%. NIC in the arterial phase showed statistically superior diagnostic 
performance compared to K values (P < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Dual-energy CT parameters, particularly NIC in the arterial phase, 
demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating CRC grades. These 
findings suggest that quantitative dual-energy CT metrics can serve as valuable 
non-invasive tools for tumor characterization, aiding in clinical 
decision-making. Study limitations include its retrospective design and 
relatively small sample size.
CONCLUSION: NIC, K, and DEI values in dual-energy CT scans are highly effective 
in distinguishing CRC differentiation grades, with arterial-phase NIC showing 
the highest diagnostic performance. These parameters may enhance preoperative 
assessment and personalized treatment strategies for CRC patients.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) participate in cancer initiation, metastasis, and 
therapy tolerance, presenting a formidable challenge in cancer treatment. 
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been established as a potential strategy 
for selectively targeting and eradicating CSCs, thereby overcoming resistance 
mechanisms and preventing tumor recurrence. ADCs integrate a monoclonal antibody 
specific to CSC surface markers, such as CD44, CD133, EpCAM, and ALDH1, with a 
potent cytotoxic payload linked by a stable chemical linker. Upon antigen 
binding, ADCs undergo receptor-mediated internalization, leading to 
intracellular payload release and CSC apoptosis. Recent advances in ADC 
technology have enhanced selectivity and efficacy while minimizing off-target 
toxicity. Preclinical studies demonstrate that CSC-targeted ADCs, including 
CD133- and CD44-directed therapies, effectively deplete CSC populations in 
glioblastoma, breast, colorectal, and lung cancers. EpCAM-targeted ADCs have 
also shown efficacy in epithelial tumors with potential synergy in combination 
immunotherapies. Moreover, emerging approaches, such as bispecific antibodies 
and optimized linker chemistry, further refine CSC-targeted ADCs for clinical 
applications. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including CSC 
heterogeneity, immune evasion, and limitations in biomarker specificity. 
Addressing these hurdles requires continued innovation in ADC engineering, novel 
payloads, and combinatory strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors or CAR-T 
cell therapies. While clinical evaluations are still in the early phases, 
preliminary trials underscore the potential of CSC-targeted ADCs in 
revolutionizing precision oncology. This review explores the mechanisms, recent 
developments, and prospects of CSC-targeted ADCs, highlighting their 
transformative potential in cancer immunotherapy.

PURPOSE: Incisional hernia (IH) often develops during surveillance after 
colorectal cancer surgery, with repair sometimes delayed due to the risk of 
recurrence. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for IH enlargement by 
objectively measuring the changes in defect size.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 83 patients who developed IH after curative 
laparoscopic colorectal surgery at the Osaka Rosai Hospital between 2017 and 
2021. Computed tomography was used to measure the IH defect sizes at diagnosis 
and at the end of the surveillance. Univariate and multivariate analyses were 
performed to determine the risk factors for enlargement.
RESULTS: The median IH defect size increased from 23.7 to 32.7 mm over a median 
follow-up of 1003 days. The highest quartile of defect size change was 12.1 mm 
and was used to classify patients into stable and enlarged IH groups. A 
multivariate analysis revealed that a high body mass index (≥ 25 kg/m2; odds 
ratio [OR] 3.527, p = 0.037), early IH discovery (< 225 days after surgery; OR 
4.753, p = 0.012), and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (> 2.45; OR 3.604, 
p = 0.031) were independent risk factors for IH enlargement.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, early IH development, and systemic inflammation are 
associated with IH progression. Careful monitoring of patients with these risk 
factors is warranted.

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, represents an 
emerging therapeutic vulnerability in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the 
epigenetic mechanisms controlling ferroptosis sensitivity in CRC remain poorly 
understood. Here, we identify histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) as a pivotal 
epigenetic suppressor of ferroptosis. Both pharmacological inhibition and 
genetic knockdown of HDAC3 significantly enhanced ferroptosis sensitivity, as 
evidenced by elevated intracellular ferrous iron (Fe2+) and lipid peroxidation. 
Mechanistically, inhibition of HDAC3 reduced the expression of nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a master antioxidant transcription factor, 
thereby leading to downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a central 
ferroptosis defense gene. Notably, NRF2 knockdown abolished GPX4 downregulation 
by HDAC3 inhibition, whereas GPX4 overexpression rescued the ferroptotic 
phenotype caused by HDAC3 depletion. Collectively, these findings define an 
HDAC3-NRF2-GPX4 axis that suppresses ferroptosis in CRC, and highlight HDAC3 as 
a potential therapeutic target for ferroptosis-based cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status has been 
proposed as a biomarker to identify colorectal cancer (CRC) patients suitable 
for anti-HER2 treatment. However, response varies from HER2-negative CRC, 
influenced by factors such as the tumors immune microenvironment (TIME) in 
HER2-positive CRC patients. We aimed to characterize the TIME of HER2-positive 
CRC by assessing the associations of inflammatory cells and prognosis.
METHODS: TIME was characterized through immunostaining for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, 
CD68, Forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
cell densities in 36 HER2-positive and 72 HER2-negative CRC patients. HER2 
positivity was evaluated by the HERACLES criteria. PD-L1 expression was 
evaluated by the tumor proportion score (TPS) and combined proportion score 
(CPS).
RESULTS: In our study, the densities of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3 cells 
and PD-L1 expression showed no statistic differences in HER2-positive CRC 
patients compared to HER2-negative patients. There was a greater proportion of 
Foxp3+ cells (≥ 10%) among patients with HER2-positive CRC (P = .023). Although 
the PD-L1 CPS was correlated with sex (P = .012), inflammatory cells and the 
PD-L1 TPS were not correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Additionally, 
CRC patients with PD-L1 CPSs ≥ 1 had significantly better event-free survival 
(EFS) than patients with PD-L1 CPSs < 1 (P = .029). For patients with 
HER2-positive CRC, higher CD68 indicated better EFS (P = .047).
CONCLUSIONS: This study characterized a preliminary immune microenvironment 
profile and indicated CD68 increased correlation with EFS for HER2-positive CRC 
patients. These immune microenvironment profiles and prognostic implications 
could serve as potential biomarkers for stratifying patients with HER-2 positive 
for clinical trials.

Dietary fiber has emerged as a central modulator of gut microbiota composition 
and host physiology, garnering unprecedented scientific attention. Here, we 
propose the "Ideal Dietary Fiber Model"-a personalized, structure-guided 
framework designed to precisely shape gut microbial ecosystems and promote host 
health. Departing from traditional fiber classifications, this model emphasizes 
the construction of composite fiber formulations based on detailed structural 
parameters, including monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage types, and 
degree of polymerization. Particular focus is given to oligosaccharides, whose 
fine structural features confer high selectivity in modulating microbial 
communities and the production of key metabolites such as short-chain fatty 
acids, indoles, and neurotransmitter precursors. This review synthesizes recent 
advances in fiber-microbiota interactions across metabolic, inflammatory, and 
neurocognitive diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, Non-Alcoholic Fatty 
Liver Disease, inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, depression, 
anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease. While mechanistic insights continue to expand, 
current evidence remains largely preclinical, highlighting the gap between 
experimental findings and clinical translation. We argue that integrating 
microbiome stratification with fiber structure-function databases will be 
essential for advancing precision nutrition. The Ideal Dietary Fiber Model 
offers a conceptual and practical foundation for microbiota-targeted dietary 
design, but its therapeutic potential requires rigorous clinical validation.

INTRODUCTION: Language barriers hinder colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in 
underserved populations of non- native English speakers, particularly in Asian 
American Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities; yet, patient educational materials 
are not readily available in languages other than English and Spanish.
METHODS: In this pilot study, American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 
infographics were translated into Chinese (traditional/simplified), Hmong, and 
Vietnamese, and distributed along with a translated pre-post survey to 
average-risk patients between 45-75 years old at a safety-net clinic. Primary 
outcomes were CRC screening rates and secondary outcomes were patients' 
perceptions of CRC screening.
RESULTS: CRC screening rates increased from 19.5% to 54.3% (p-value <0.01), 
while more than 80.0% noted increased understanding of CRC and plans to pursue 
screening.
DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that providing translated, 
language-concordant infographics significantly increased CRC screening rates and 
patient understanding among non-native English speakers. Creating and 
integrating the use of culturally and linguistically tailored educational 
materials in resource-limited clinics can help eliminate disparities and narrow 
the colorectal cancer screening gap in AAPI communities.

Liver metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is the main cause of death for 
colorectal cancer. Recent studies have shown that, chromosomal instability (CIN) 
and the tumor microenvironment (TME) play critical roles in the process of liver 
metastasis in CRC, influencing both prognosis and therapeutic outcomes. The 
immune cells in the TME, especially the polarization of macrophages, which 
regulates immune suppression and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, becomes 
a key driving factor for colorectal cancer liver metastasis. CIN enhances the 
plasticity of the tumor genome, activates metastasis-related pathways, and 
remodels the liver microenvironment, becoming an important driving force for 
colorectal cancer liver metastasis. This comprehensive review synthesizes the 
epidemiological researches of CRC, the impacts of chromosomal instability on 
liver metastasis and the mechanisms by which tumor microenvironment contributes 
to metastasis. It then explores the genes and related pathways that play an 
important role in the processes of TME and CIN were summarized, and their 
connections with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) were studied. 
Finally, based on the above studies, the clinical significance in prognosis and 
treatment was discussed, potential targeted points with pertinence were 
proposed, and combined with the existing drug research, the feasibility of the 
conclusions was further demonstrated.

BACKGROUND: Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 
induce de novo gut synthesis of vitamin D to inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis 
in mice. Magnesium (Mg) treatment increases circulating vitamin D and Mg 
homeostasis is dependent on TRPM7 genotype.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that Mg treatment increases gut C. maltaromaticum and 
F. prausnitzii and the effect differs by TRPM7 polymorphism.
METHODS: The Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial is a 
double-blind, precision-based randomized controlled trial with 240 participants 
randomized by both treatment and TRPM7 genotype. Stool, rectal swabs, and rectal 
mucosa were collected.
RESULTS: Of 239 participants that completed the trial, 226 with valid microbiome 
data were analyzed (treatment n=112, placebo n=114). The interaction between 
treatment and TRPM7 genotype was only significant for C. maltaromaticum 
(p=0.001) and F. prausnitzii (p=0.02) in rectal swabs. In a stratified analysis 
by TRPM7 genotype without the missense variant, Mg treatment compared to placebo 
significantly increased abundance of C. maltaromaticum (0.217±0.615 (23.01%) 
compared to -0.065±0.588 (-6.30%); P=0.006) and F. prausnitzii (0.105±0.817 
(2.13%) compared to -0.095±0.856 (-1.92%); P =0.04) in rectal swabs. The effect 
on C. maltaromaticum remained after multiple comparisons (Q=0.05 for C. 
maltaromaticum across all sample types and genotypes). In those with the TRPM7 
missense variant, Mg decreased C. maltaromaticum, but not F. prausnitzii, 
compared to placebo in rectal swabs (-0.065±0.511 (-6.54%) compared to 
0.133±0.503 (13.30%); adjusted P=0.04). The effect did not remain after FDR 
correction. Mg treatment's effect on C. maltaromaticum in rectal swabs primarily 
appeared in females, and the treatment-genotype interaction remained 
significant.
CONCLUSION: In individuals with adequate TRPM7 function, Mg supplementation 
increases abundance of C. maltaromaticum and F. prausnitzii.

BACKGROUND: Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as diagnosis before 
age 50, is a growing public health concern. Despite increasing national 
incidence among younger adults, state-specific analyses for Florida remain 
limited. Florida's large and demographically unique population necessitates 
investigation into EOCRC trends and patient characteristics.
METHODS: This population-based study utilized colorectal cancer incidence data 
for Florida residents aged 25-49 diagnosed between 2002 and 2021, from the 
Florida Cancer Data System and National Program of Cancer Registries. Joinpoint 
regression evaluated age-adjusted incidence trends across demographic and 
clinical factors. Age-period-cohort analysis explored generational effects, 
while multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with 
advanced-stage diagnosis (regional or distant).
RESULTS: Among 16,318 EOCRC cases identified during 2002-2021, overall incidence 
increased significantly (AAPC=1.48 %, P < .001), driven primarily by colon 
cancers (AAPC=1.53 %, P < .001), while rectal cancers showed non-significant 
increase (AAPC=0.53 %, P = 0.185). A concerning shift toward advanced stages at 
diagnosis emerged (P < 0.001), with localized disease decreasing from 32.8 % to 
26.2 %, while regional (34.6-41.0 %) and distant metastases (21.9-26.8 %) 
increased substantially. This stage migration was confirmed by significant 
increases in regional (AAPC=2.10 %, P < .001) and distant disease (AAPC=2.71 %, 
P < .001) incidence. Strong birth cohort effects, indicating increasing risk 
with rate ratios exceeding 2.0 for recent cohorts, were evident predominantly in 
non-Hispanic White individuals. Conversely, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black 
patients showed no significant cohort effects but consistently presented with 
higher odds of advanced-stage disease compared to non-Hispanic Whites (AOR=1.13 
and AOR=1.11, respectively). Uninsured (AOR=1.23) and Medicaid-covered patients 
(AOR=1.52) faced significantly higher odds of advanced presentation compared to 
privately insured individuals.
CONCLUSION: Florida experienced sustained EOCRC incidence increases from 2002 to 
2021, accompanied by advanced-stage diagnosis increases and notable disparities. 
Birth cohort effects primarily drove increased risk in non-Hispanic White 
populations, while barriers to timely care, including insurance status, likely 
contributed to delayed diagnoses in minority communities, underscoring urgent 
needs for targeted interventions.

BACKGROUND: Due to the heterogeneity of colorectal cancer (CRC), models that can 
predict the chemotherapy response are needed to facilitate personalized 
treatment.
AIM: To construct patient-derived tumor-like cell cluster (PTC) models in vitro 
drug sensitivity screening for CRC personalized chemotherapy.
METHODS: We collected 140 CRC tissues via surgical resection in three Chinese 
hospitals and establish PTC models which is highly similar to the original tumor 
tissue. The sensitivity to various chemotherapy drugs was assessed in these PTC 
models. We recorded the PTC model cultivation process and patients' clinical 
data and assessed the concordance between in vitro drug sensitivity and clinical 
outcomes.
RESULTS: PTC models were successfully established from 124 specimens, with a 
success rate of 88.6 %. The average culture time was 3.02 ± 1.56 days, and the 
median time to obtain drug sensitivity results was 11 days (10-13 days). Drug 
sensitivity testing revealed that the PTC models had variable responses to 
different chemotherapy regimens, with some patients showing unexpected 
sensitivity to regimens not typically considered first-line treatments. The 
median follow-up time for all patients was 19 months, and there was no 
significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between patients whose 
actual responses to clinical treatment regimens were consistent or inconsistent 
with the PTC model predictions.
CONCLUSION: The PTC model for drug sensitivity testing has advantages of high 
success rate and rapid drug screening time. This study provides a promising tool 
for personalized chemotherapy sensitivity screening in patients with CRC and, 
after further clinical trials, may guide clinical treatment decision making.

Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, exhibits potent anti-cancer activities, but its 
underlying molecular mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) are not fully 
elucidated. Here, we investigated t whether curcumin suppresses CRC by targeting 
tripartite motif-containing protein 2 (TRIM2) and its downstream the Mammalian 
Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. We initially performed a 
whole-genome expression profile chip to examine gene alterations following 
curcumin administration. Our results demonstrate that curcumin effectively 
decreased the expression of TRIM2 in CRC cells. Furthermore, PCR and 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tumour samples confirmed the elevated 
expression of TRIM2 in CRC cells and CRC tumour samples. Additionally, we 
assessed the effect of TRIM2 knockdown on the proliferation of CRC cells and 
tumour growth using cell and animal experiments. mTOR pathway activity was 
interrogated using phospho‑kinase arrays and immunoblotting, with pharmacologic 
rescue by an mTOR activator. Our findings revealed that curcumin administration 
and TRIM2 knockdown effectively suppressed the migration and proliferation of 
CRC cells and mTOR activation partially reversed these effects, Mechanistically, 
TRIM2 depletion dampened mTOR signaling, reducing phosphorylation of AKT 
(Ser473), and S6K/4EBP1 without altering total protein levels. These findings 
indicate curcumin inhibits CRC onset and progression by downregulating TRIM2 and 
suppressing mTOR pathway activity, suggesting TRIM2 may serve as a potential 
prognostic marker in CRC.

INTRODUCTION: The RAPIDO and PRODIGE-23 randomised trials of neoadjuvant versus 
adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer showed that disease-free survival (DFS) 
curves diverged early, suggesting that much of the benefit from neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy occurred within six months. We aimed to determine whether the DFS 
benefit at six months in trials evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy can predict 
the benefit at 36 months, and to compare the timing of DFS benefit in trials of 
neoadjuvant versus in those of adjuvant chemotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review identified ten randomised trials 
comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant chemotherapy and 37 randomised trials of 
adjuvant chemotherapy eligible for meta-analysis in rectal or colon cancer. 
Absolute differences in DFS between experimental and control groups at six and 
36 months were extracted from Kaplan-Meier curves. The increment in the DFS 
benefit between the sixth and 36th months was calculated.
RESULTS: In neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials, DFS benefit at six months (3.7 %, 
95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.9 to 5.4) did not differ significantly from 
that at 36 months (4.1 %, 95 % CI: 2.0 to 6.3), and the pooled absolute 
increment in DFS benefit between the sixth and 36th months was only 0.8 % (95 % 
CI: -1.6 to 3.2). The DFS benefit emerged earlier in neoadjuvant than in 
adjuvant chemotherapy trials.
CONCLUSION: In randomised trials comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant 
chemotherapy, most of the DFS benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy manifests 
itself within the first six months. Therefore, assessing DFS at six months may 
potentially serve as an early indicator of long-term efficacy.

A Breakthrough Alongside Prenatal Studies by Non-invasive Prenatal Testing 
(NIPT): The Prospective Discovery of Maternal Cancers Through the IDENTIFY 
Study.

Garcia-Heras J(1).

A recent prospective study run by the IDENTIFY project at the U.S. National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) uncovered occult cancers in pregnant or postpartum 
women who previously received Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) reports of 
atypical abnormal/ unreportable results that were discordant with the fetal 
genotype. Among 107/117 patients enrolled who received a full evaluation, 52 
(48.6%) had cancers, mostly lymphomas (31/52), colorectal tumors (9/52), and 
breast cancer (4/52). These results were gathered through standardized research 
cfDNA sequencing in peripheral blood and a comprehensive cancer screening 
protocol. Most of these patients (47/52) showed a sequencing pattern in cfDNA of 
multiple subchromosomal and/or whole gains and losses in multiple chromosomes 
(≥3). This pattern was interpreted as a high-risk indicator of cancers. Except 
for whole-body MRI imaging, which was very effective in discovering tumors 
(49/101 cases), the rest of the cancer screening was not informative. The whole 
data strengthen the view that NIPT has clinical value for a preliminary 
identification of pregnant women who may have hidden malignancies and should be 
referred for a thorough cancer screening. In addition, a uniform follow-up 
protocol of comprehensive cancer screening allowed the diagnosis of a 
substantial number of cancers that otherwise would not have been detected. 
Overall, these results from IDENTIFY, the first via a prospective study, also 
represent progress in guidelines for improved identification and management of 
occult malignancies coexisting with pregnancies.

PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) often involves liver. However, the standard 
treatment for CRC with liver metastases (CRC-LM) is debatable. This 
meta-analysis compares the efficacy of ablation with surgical resection in 
CRC-LM patients.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, 
ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Library. Studies published during January 2020 
to February 2025 and comparing any form of ablation with surgical resection in 
adult patients with CRC-LM were included. The primary outcomes were overall 
survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), while the secondary outcomes were 
recurrence patterns, length of hospital stay, and complication rates.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled 
analysis revealed a significant difference in OS favoring surgical resection 
(RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.92, p = 0.001, I2 = 33%), while DFS showed no 
significant difference between the groups (RR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.53, 
p = 0.44, I2 = 85%). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the ablation 
group (MD -1.44; 95% CI -2.18,-0.69; p = 0.0001; I2 = 97%), and the rate of 
major complications was also significantly lower with ablation (RR 0.26; 95% CI 
0.18-0.38; p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%). Additionally, ablation and resection were 
comparable in terms of both local recurrence (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.86-1.86; 
p = 0.23; I2 = 38%) and appearance of new lesions (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.75-1.29; 
p = 0.90; I2 = 9%).
CONCLUSION: Surgical resection offered superior OS compared to thermal ablation 
for CRC-LM patients. However, thermal ablation was associated with shorter 
hospital stay and fewer major complications, highlighting its value as a less 
invasive alternative in selected patients.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: There are differences, with genetic and embryologic 
support, in the clinical behavior of proximal colon cancer (PCC) (right colon: 
cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon) and distal colon cancer (DCC) 
(left colon: descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum). Our aim was to determine 
whether there was a divergent pattern in the demographic characteristics, risk 
factors, TNM stage, and clinical stage at diagnosis between patients with PCC 
and those with DCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, analytic, and multicenter study was 
conducted. Medical records of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, 
confirmed by histopathology and with TNM staging, within the time frame of 
2018-2023, were collected from two hospital centers in the city of Chihuahua. 
They were divided into the PCC and DCC groups, for evaluating the abovementioned 
characteristics.
RESULTS: From a total of 513 cases, 404 were included in the study. Significant 
differences were found in the demographic characteristics of female sex and a 
history of cholecystectomy, both with a greater relative frequency for PCC. 
Distant metastasis was present in 35.6% of patients, despite their younger age 
at diagnosis. The rectum was the most commonly affected segment in the DCC 
group, as was the ascending colon in the PCC group. There was a greater 
prevalence of peritoneal carcinomatosis in the PCC group. In contrast, the DCC 
group had a greater prevalence of distant metastasis to other organs, as both 
individual metastasis (M1a) and multiple site metastasis (M1b). There were no 
considerable differences in the KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF gene mutations between the 
two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: PCC was associated with a history of cholecystectomy and female sex 
and had more aggressive TNM staging, compared with DCC.

Berberine (BBR) and rosmarinic acid (RA) exhibit potent anticancer effects 
against colorectal cancer; however, they still suffer from poor stability and 
low bioavailability. Herein, we developed a pH-responsive and colon-targeted 
delivery system by encapsulating self-assembled BBR-RA nanoparticles (BBR-RA 
NPs) within Ca2+-crosslinked alginate (ALG)/sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) 
hydrogels (ALG/CMC/BBR-RA NPs). The physicochemical characteristics of BBR-RA 
NPs and ALG/CMC/BBR-RA NPs were analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, 1H NMR, 
TEM, SEM, and XRD. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the formation of 
BBR-RA NPs was driven by π-π conjugation, electrostatic interactions, and 
hydrogen bonding. BBR-RA NPs exhibited a high encapsulation efficiency (72.69 %) 
and loading capacity (54.08 %), possessing good stability under physiological 
conditions. Rheological assessments confirmed the excellent mechanical 
properties and stability of ALG/CMC/BBR-RA NPs. Swelling and degradation 
studies, along with in vitro release, demonstrated that the hydrogels 
effectively protected BBR-RA NPs from premature degradation in acidic 
environments while enabling pH-responsive and controlled release in colon. 
Moreover, ALG/CMC/BBR-RA NPs enhanced cellular uptake, reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) generation, and apoptosis in CT26 and HT29 colorectal cancer cells, 
outperforming free BBR and RA. These findings underscore the potential of 
ALG/CMC/BBR-RA NPs for improving the anticancer bioactivities of BBR and RA in 
colorectal cancer treatment.

The brief lifetime of reduced O2 levels and oxygen species during ferroptosis in 
cancer cell lines undermines the ferroptosis efficacy. Enhancing the 
effectiveness of real-time created active oxygen species is crucial for 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The Evofosfamide (EFA) encapsulated polydopamine 
(PD)-iron (Fe) nanoparticles (Fe/PD-EFA) were modified with unsaturated 
liposomes (Lipo) to address the limitations of conventional ferroptosis therapy. 
The Lipo@Fe/PD-EFA can interact with H2O2 to generate •OH, which subsequently 
targets Lipo, resulting in the formation of a phospholipid peroxide radical 
(LOO•) and a radical intermediate (L•) to mitigate the detrimental effects of 
the •OH. Liposomes facilitate oxygen consumption and augment lipid peroxidation, 
thereby exacerbating hypoxia at the site of pancreatic cancer. The EFA can be 
activated by reductase in cancer cell lines under a hypoxic milieu, which 
diminishes free radicals through the reductase enzyme and disrupts the adjacent 
biomacromolecules' structure, thereby facilitating the synergistic therapy of 
chemotherapy and ferroptosis in Panc-1 cells. This study integrates improved 
ferroptosis with hypoxia-activated chemotherapy to generate an effective and 
targeted tumoricidal impact, perhaps offering a promising treatment for 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the future.

Cancer stemness in colorectal cancer (CRC) drives immune evasion and fosters an 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), limiting the efficacy of 
immunotherapy. To counteract this stemness-driven immune evasion, we developed a 
hyaluronic acid (HA) surface-modified dual-targeting nanoplatform (HA/pCe6-Ato 
NPs) that induces both endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial 
dysfunction. HA functionalization facilitates tumor-specific targeting via CD44 
receptor-mediated endocytosis. The nanoplatform incorporates an ER-targeting 
photosensitizer, pCe6, synthesized by conjugating Chlorin e6 with 
p-Toluenesulfonamide, and the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor 
atovaquone (Ato), which self-assembles into nanoparticles. Upon activation, 
HA/pCe6-Ato NPs induce ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupting 
cancer stemness and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. Preclinical 
evaluations showed that HA/pCe6-Ato NPs promote apoptosis and accelerate 
reactive oxygen species production in cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), while 
reducing immunosuppressive factor secretion and enhancing immune effector cell 
infiltration. These effects synergistically enhance the efficacy of 
immunotherapy, achieving superior tumor inhibition compared with conventional 
monotherapies. Collectively, HA/pCe6-Ato NPs highlight the potential of 
organelle-targeting strategies to dismantle cancer resilience mechanisms, 
providing a foundation for dual-targeting nanomedicines to overcome resistance 
and enhance immunotherapy in CRC.

Benchmarking progress in non-communicable diseases: a global analysis of 
cause-specific mortality from 2001 to 2019.

BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have received substantial policy 
attention globally and in most countries. Our aim was to quantify how much NCD 
mortality changed from 2010 to 2019 in different countries, especially compared 
with the preceding decade and with the best-performing country in each region, 
and the specific NCD causes of death that contributed to change.
METHODS: We used data on NCD mortality by sex, age group, and underlying cause 
of death for 185 countries and territories from the 2021 WHO Global Health 
Estimates. Our primary outcome was the probability of dying from an NCD between 
birth and age 80 years in the absence of competing causes of death, and was 
calculated using age-specific death rates from NCDs and lifetable methods. We 
calculated change in the probability of death as the difference between values 
in the final and first year of each period (2001-10 and 2010-19). For 51 
countries with high-quality mortality data and 12 countries with large 
populations within their region, we used the Horiuchi method of decomposition to 
calculate how much specific causes of death and 5-year age groups contributed 
towards: (1) increases or decreases in NCD mortality from 2010 to 2019; (2) 
improvements or deteriorations compared with the preceding decade (2001-10); and 
(3) differences from the country that had the largest reduction in each region.
FINDINGS: From 2010 to 2019, the probability of dying from an NCD between birth 
and age 80 years decreased in 152 (82%) of 185 countries for females and in 147 
(79%) countries for males; it increased in the remaining 33 (18%) countries for 
females and 38 (21%) countries for males. The countries where NCD mortality 
declined for females accounted for 72% of the world female population in 2019, 
and those where NCD mortality declined for males accounted for 73% of the world 
male population. NCD mortality declined in all high-income western countries, 
with Denmark experiencing the largest decline for both sexes and the USA 
experiencing the smallest decline. Among the largest countries in other regions, 
NCD mortality declined for both sexes in China, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, and 
Brazil, and increased for both sexes in India and Papua New Guinea. On average, 
females in countries in the central Asia, Middle East and north Africa region 
had the greatest reduction in NCD mortality followed by those in central and 
eastern Europe. For males, the largest reduction was among countries in central 
and eastern Europe, followed by those in central Asia, Middle East and north 
Africa. The smallest declines were those in the Pacific Island nations. 
Circulatory diseases were the greatest contributors to declines in NCD mortality 
from 2010 to 2019 in most countries, with some cancers (eg, stomach and 
colorectal cancers for both sexes, cervical and breast cancers for females, and 
lung and prostate cancers for males) also contributing towards lower NCD 
mortality in 2019 than in 2010 in many countries. Neuropsychiatric conditions 
and pancreatic and liver cancers contributed towards higher NCD mortality from 
2010 to 2019 in most countries. In some countries, NCD mortality in working and 
older (≥65 years) ages changed in the same direction leading to large overall 
declines or increases; in others, it changed in opposite directions, diminishing 
the magnitude of the overall change. In 75 (41%) of 185 countries for females 
and in 73 (39%) countries for males, the change in NCD mortality from 2010 to 
2019 was an improvement (ie, larger decline, smaller increase, or reversal of an 
increase) compared with the change from 2001 to 2010. These countries accounted 
for 29% and 63% of the world female and male population, respectively, and 
included both sexes in Russia and Egypt, and males in China, India, and Brazil. 
Decadal changes saw a deterioration (ie, smaller decline, larger increase, or 
reversal of a decline) in the remaining 110 (59%) countries for females and 112 
(61%) countries for males, including in both sexes in the USA, Nigeria, and 
Papua New Guinea, and females in China, India, and Brazil. Change from 2010 to 
2019 saw deterioration in direction or size compared with the preceding decade 
for both sexes in most high-income western countries, most countries in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, and in east and southeast Asia, and for females in 
south Asia. There was a decadal improvement in the direction or size of change 
for many countries in central and eastern Europe (eg, Russia) and central Asia, 
and in parts of the Middle East and north Africa. Improvements or deteriorations 
in the direction or size of change in NCD mortality between the two decades 
resulted from multiple NCD causes of death. Among causes of death, the decline 
in mortality from circulatory diseases was smaller from 2010 to 2019 than from 
2001 to 2010 in most countries, except in countries in central and eastern 
Europe and some countries in central Asia, where these declines were larger from 
2010 to 2019 than from 2001 to 2010. Change in lung cancer saw a decadal 
improvement in many countries, especially for males, and many other cancers saw 
a mix of improvement and deterioration.
INTERPRETATION: From 2010 to 2019, NCD mortality declined in four of every five 
countries in the world. These improvements were not as large as the preceding 
decade for most countries, driven by smaller declines in mortality from multiple 
NCDs.

Colorectal cancer has emerged as a leading cause of global cancer-related 
morbidity and mortality, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. We 
developed a desilication-recrystallization method to synthesize Silicalite-1-X 
(X = 2, 8, 16, 32), a hierarchical porous silica molecular sieve with 
cost-effectiveness, facile synthesis, and tunable porosity. Its programmable 
mesoporous structure is achieved by precisely controlling the 
desilication-recrystallization kinetics. Tunable mesopores with precise 
diameters of 4-6 nm and 20-30 nm were fabricated by controlling cavity expansion 
through temporal modulation (2-32 h) of a time-dependent synthesis process. 
Detailed analysis of drug loading and release profiles revealed that although 
pore structure modification did not significantly alter drug loading efficiency 
(DLE), it induced a slight but consistent improvement in drug release rate as 
pore size increased. Systematic biocompatibility evaluation was conducted 
through an in vitro human colonic epithelial tissue model complemented by the KM 
mice in vivo studies. Histopathological analysis confirmed Silicalite-1-X caused 
minimal cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in healthy colon tissue, preserved 
mucus secretion, and showed no systemic toxicity. Furthermore, Doxorubicin (DOX) 
loaded Silicalite-1-X platform (Silicalite-1-DOX-X) exhibited dose-dependent 
cytotoxic efficacy against colorectal carcinoma in vitro models, confirming its 
anti-tumor therapeutic potential. Our findings provide a framework for 
engineering molecular sieves with tunable porosity and a platform for expanding 
their multifunctional applications in advanced materials.

A machine learning-Assisted QSAR and integrative computational combined with 
network pharmacology approach for rational identification of tankyrase 
inhibitors in colon adenocarcinoma.

The dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway serves as a central 
driver of Colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation and progression. Tankyrase (TNKS), 
a PARP family enzyme, facilitates Wnt-driven tumorigenesis by PARylating and 
destabilizing Axin, thereby promoting β-catenin accumulation. In APC-mutated 
CRC, TNKS inhibition restores β-catenin degradation, highlighting its potential 
as a therapeutic target. To address this gap, an integrative QSAR model was 
constructed to identify novel TNKS inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetic and 
therapeutic efficacy. A dataset of 1100 TNKS inhibitors was retrieved from the 
ChEMBL database and subjected to ligand-based QSAR modeling to predict potent 
chemical scaffolds based on 2D and 3D structural and physicochemical molecular 
descriptors. To enhance model reliability, Machine learning (ML) approaches such 
as feature selection and random forest (RF) classification models were applied. 
The models were trained, optimized, and rigorously validated using internal 
(cross-validation) and external test sets, achieving a high predictive 
performance (ROC-AUC) of 0.98. Virtual screening of prioritized candidates was 
complemented by molecular docking, dynamic simulation, and principal component 
analysis to evaluate binding affinity, complex stability, and conformational 
landscapes. This strategy led to the identification of a potential TNKS 
inhibitor, Q1 (Olaparib), as a possible repurposed drug against TNKS. Network 
pharmacology further contextualized TNKS within CRC biology, mapping 
disease-gene interactions and functional enrichment to uncover TNKS-associated 
roles in oncogenic pathways. Collectively, these findings underscore the 
effectiveness of combining machine learning and system biology to accelerate 
rational drug discovery. Olaparib emerges as a promising candidate for 
TNKS-targeted therapy, providing a strong computational foundation for 
experimental validation and future preclinical drug development.

Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a serious complication following colorectal cancer 
surgery, resulting in increased morbidity, extended hospital stays, and higher 
mortality rates. Current methods for AL monitoring are often delayed, 
non-specific, and unsuitable for long-term point-of-care (POC) applications, 
highlighting the need for cost-effective, portable biosensors. Amylase, a 
promising biomarker present in peritoneal fluid, offers hope for early and 
long-term detection of AL. In this study, we present a miniaturized microwave 
biosensor capable of quasi-continuous (e.g. hourly) monitoring of amylase 
concentrations from postoperative day 1 and for a long time. The sensor detects 
clinically relevant amylase concentrations (>1000 U/L) within an hour, enabling 
early and prolonged monitoring of AL. High specificity was achieved using an 
amylopectin coating that reacts selectively with amylase, even in complex 
samples such as simulated peritoneal fluid (SPF). We validated the performance 
of our miniaturized, portable microwave sensor against the EnzChek™ Ultra 
Amylase Assay Kit, confirming its accuracy and reliability. This low-cost, 
portable biosensor provides a proof-of-concept for a practical, highly specific 
POC solution for real-time AL monitoring, supporting both early diagnosis and 
long-term postoperative care.

SUMOylation is a critical post-translational modification that modulates protein 
activity, stability, and subcellular distribution through the covalent 
attachment of SUMO proteins (SUMO1-5) to specific targets. This process is 
mediated by a cascade of enzymes, including E1, E2, E3 ligases, and 
deSUMOylation enzymes, enabling precise control over diverse biological 
functions such as gene expression, cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, 
signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. Dysregulation of SUMOylation enzymes 
has been contributes to cancer initiation, and treatment resistance, by 
enhancing tumor cell motility, aggressiveness, and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT). In gastrointestinal malignancies-including gastric, hepatic, 
colorectal, esophageal, gallbladder, and pancreatic cancers-SUMOylation drives 
tumor growth, metastasis, and invasiveness by reprogramming metabolic processes, 
signaling networks, and the surrounding tumor niche. Additionally, it 
contributes to resistance against chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Understanding 
the molecular basis of SUMOylation not only underscores its significance in 
oncogenesis but also provides a foundation for developing novel anticancer 
therapies.

Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) combined with machine learning offers 
a transformative label-free approach for colorectal cancer detection, addressing 
limitations of current diagnostic methods such as invasiveness, high cost, and 
limited accessibility. In this study, we developed a liquid biopsy platform 
utilizing a bacterial cellulose substrate functionalized with silver 
nanoparticles, synthesized via an ascorbic acid cycling reduction method, to 
enhance SERS signals from plasma without the need for complex reagents. The 
study enrolled 20 colorectal cancer patients and 20 healthy volunteers, and 
plasma SERS spectra were collected from each participant. To improve 
reproducibility and minimize environmental interference, 4-mercaptopyridine was 
introduced as an internal standard for signal calibration. Machine learning 
models-including Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest 
(RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)-achieved classification accuracies all 
exceeding 86.25 %, with SVM reaching 100 % accuracy in distinguishing between 
colorectal cancer patients and healthy individuals. This study establishes a 
clinically promising SERS-machine learning framework that integrates 
standardized calibration with interpretable artificial intelligence, 
facilitating rapid cancer screening and advancing precision oncology. It should 
be noted, however, that these findings are based on a limited sample size, and 
further validation in larger cohorts is essential.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) play crucial roles in metabolizing diverse 
substances, including drugs, pollutants, hormones, and steroids. Among them, 
CYP1B1 has gained significant attention due to its involvement in cancer 
initiation, progression, and drug resistance. Overexpression of CYP1B1 is 
frequently observed in multiple cancers, including breast, lung, colorectal, and 
brain cancers, making it an important therapeutic target. This review is an 
update covering the last six years (2019-2025) to our earlier publication 
proposing linker-based classification. Articles published over this period 
broadly covers efforts taken to increase the aqueous solubility α-naphthoflavone 
derivatives and ability to reverse the resistance to main-stream anticancer 
agents. We also covered PET tracers and PROTACs designed to hit the CYP1B1 by 
conjugating appropriate elements to the potent CYP1B1 inhibitors reported 
earlier. Overall, this review highlights significant recent innovations and 
strategic advancements in CYP1B1 inhibitor research, offering promising 
directions for cancer diagnosis and treatment.

IntroductionColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide 
and a significant public health threat with far-reaching societal implications. 
The currently available CRC therapeutic strategies have limitations, thus 
requiring the development of new strategies. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) exhibits 
strong oncolytic activity in CRC, although its mechanism of action remains 
unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether the induction of ferroptosis is 
a promising treatment strategy for CRC and whether CVB3 could activate 
ferroptosis during infection.MethodsIn vitro and in vivo experiments were 
conducted to evaluate whether CVB3 infection activates the ferroptosis pathway 
by upregulating miR-214-3p to suppress glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) 
expression. Dual-luciferase assays and rescue experiments were performed to 
confirm this regulatory mechanism. Clinical CRC tissues and colon cancer 
xenograft models were used to demonstrate the mediating role of the 
miR-214-3p/GPX4 axis in the interaction between viral replication and 
ferroptosis.ResultsCVB3 demonstrated oncolytic virus properties by selectively 
lysing tumor cells. The in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that CVB3 
activates the ferroptosis pathway by upregulating miR-214-3p to suppress GPX4 
expression, thereby promoting viral replication and tumor regression. 
Antagonizing miR-214-3p reversed this process.ConclusionmiR-214-3p expression 
was upregulated during CVB3 infection of CRC tissues and cells, activating the 
ferroptosis pathway and promoting tumor cell death.

BackgroundWe compared short-term outcomes of laparoscopic surgery and open 
surgery (OS) for older patients with large (≧ 5 cm) colonic 
adenocarcinomas.MethodsPatients ≥ 75 years with stage I-III colon cancer were 
identified in the NCDB (2010-2020). Patients were divided into laparoscopic or 
OS groups and propensity-score matched, and outcomes were compared. Primary 
outcomes were 30- and 90-day mortality and secondary outcomes were hospital 
stay, positive resection margins, and harvested lymph node number.Results15,253 
patients were included (MIS = 5860; OS = 8486), with 5672 in each group after 
matching. 68.2% of cancers were right-sided. Laparoscopic surgery was associated 
with lower 30-day (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.66; P < 0.001) and 90-day mortality 
rates (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.66; P < 0.001) compared to OS. Laparoscopic 
surgery was significantly associated with lower 30- and 90-day mortality and 
shorter hospital stays for all tumor locations. Laparosscopic surgery for 
right-sided tumors was more often associated with negative resection margins 
(94.4% vs 92.8%; P = 0.005), and shorter hospital stays (5.0 [4.0-7.0] vs 6.0 
[5.0-9.0] days; P < 0.001). Laparoscopic surgery was associated with more 
harvested lymph nodes in right colon cancers (median: 20.0 [15.0-26.0] vs 19.0 
[15.0-25.0]; P < 0.001) and left colon cancers (18.0 [14.0-23.0] vs 17.0 
[13.0-23.0]; P = 0.001) cancers, but not in transverse colon cancers (18.0 
[14.0-25.0] vs 19.0 [14.0-25.0]; P = 0.518).ConclusionThis study highlights the 
potential for laparoscopic surgery in elderly patients with large colonic 
adenocarcinomas. Findings were consistent when stratified by tumor location, 
except transverse colon cancers where resection quality was comparable to OS.

Abha, 61441, Saudi Arabia. korayg@kku.edu.sa.

BACKGROUND: Gastric acid suppressants, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, are widely used globally. Their long-term 
safety remains a concern, particularly regarding gastrointestinal cancer risks.
AIMS: To assess population-level associations between gastric acid suppressant 
use and the incidence of major gastrointestinal cancers, adjusting for potential 
confounders.
METHODS: This ecological panel study analyzed country-year data from 24 nations 
(1990-2020). Consumption of acid suppressants (ATC A02B, DDD/1000/day) was 
obtained from OECD Health Statistics. Age-standardized cancer incidence rates 
(colorectal, liver, pancreatic, esophageal) were sourced from the GBD 2019 
dataset. Multivariable linear mixed-effects models were adjusted for dietary 
risks, BMI, tobacco, alcohol, antibiotics, NSAIDs, and GDP per capita.
RESULTS: Higher acid suppressant use was significantly associated with increased 
liver cancer (β = 0.0086; 95% CI 0.0019 to 0.0154; p = 0.0136) and pancreatic 
cancer (β = 0.0148; 95% CI 0.0068 to 0.0227; p = 0.0004) incidence. No 
significant associations were found for colorectal or esophageal cancers. Model 
fit was strongest for liver and pancreatic outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: While causal inference cannot be drawn from ecological data, the 
findings suggest a population-level association between gastric acid suppressant 
consumption and increased liver and pancreatic cancer incidence. These results 
support the need for cautious prescribing and further research using 
individual-level data.

Most cells produce latent transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), but only 
very few activate the cytokine via cell type-specific mechanisms. TGF-β1 favors 
cancer progression by suppressing anti-tumor T cell responses. Which cells 
produce this immunosuppressive TGF-β1 in human tumors is unknown. Putative 
sources include cells expressing the glycoprotein A repetitions predominant 
(GARP) protein, comprising mostly activated regulatory T cells (Tregs) 
(GARP+FOXP3+ cells) and blood endothelial cells (BECs). We performed multiplexed 
immunohistofluorescence and computerized image analyses on 186 tumor samples 
from 5 cancer types (colorectal, urothelial, lung and breast primary carcinomas 
and melanoma metastases), compared to patient-matched adjacent non-cancerous 
tissues. GARP+ Tregs were present in 29-75% of the various types of tumor 
samples. Their proportion was higher in tumors than non-cancerous tissues but 
unexpectedly it did not correlate with that of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes 
(TILs). The density of blood vessels was similar across samples, with more than 
half expressing GARP. The proportion of cells undergoing TGF-β1 signaling, which 
express the phosphorylated form of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 
(pSMAD2), was approximately twice as high in tumors compared to non-cancerous 
tissues. In most tumor types, pSMAD2+ TILs were twice closer to the nearest 
FOXP3+ cell than after random repositioning, at a distance (~ 70 µm) consistent 
with short-range paracrine TGF-β1 signaling. In contrast, pSMAD2+ non-T cells 
and pSMAD2- TILs were not closer to FOXP3+ cells, neither were pSMAD2+ cells 
(TILs and others) to BECs. We conclude that, in human tumors, GARP-expressing 
Tregs rather than BECs appear to represent a source of TGF-β1 suppressing nearby 
TILs. This local immunosuppression could be blocked with anti-GARP:TGF-β1 
antibodies, particularly to treat patients with tumors heavily infiltrated by 
GARP-expressing Tregs.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Development of new 
methods or improving the efficiency of already existing methods is essential in 
the successful treatment of this disease. Topotecan, a chemotherapeutic drug, 
has been used to inhibit various cancer types. However, chemotherapy resistance 
to this drug in cancer has impeded its maximum performance. miRNAs and other 
non-coding RNAs play crucial roles in regulating this attribute. In this 
systematic review, we investigated the interaction mechanism between these 
molecules and Topotecan in the modulation of cancer sensitivity to this agent. 
This study was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and 
Web of Science databases were comprehensively searched, using our predefined 
search terms. Following a selective process based on strategic criteria, eleven 
studies were included in the analysis. Altered expression levels of non-coding 
RNAs, especially miRNAs, regulated the sensitivity of cancer cell lines and 
animal models, directly and indirectly, through affecting cascades of signaling 
molecules. This impact was recorded in a variety of cancer types, including 
retinoblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, breast 
cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia. The highlighted interactions potentially 
offer new opportunities for modifying therapeutic intervention utilizing 
chemotherapeutic agents.

PURPOSE: This study compared complete response (CR) outcomes between two total 
neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) strategies for locally advanced rectal cancer: 
induction chemotherapy followed by long-course chemoradiotherapy (INCT-LCCRT) 
versus short-course radiotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy 
(SCRT-CNCT).
METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study were 234 patients with 
clinical stage T3-4NanyM0 low rectal cancer, treated between 2011 and 2022 with 
TNT and either total mesorectal excision or non-operative management (NOM). CR 
was defined as pathological CR after resection or sustained clinical CR in NOM. 
Propensity score matching was applied to adjust baseline differences, resulting 
in 38 matched pairs. We evaluated CR rates and survival outcomes.
RESULTS: There were 194 patients treated with INCT-LCCRT and 40 treated with 
SCRT-CNCT. The INCT-LCCRT group had more advanced disease features, including 
higher rates of clinical T4 (29.9% vs. 2.5%) and lateral pelvic node metastases 
(62.4% vs. 10%). The CR rates were comparable in the full cohort (30.9% vs. 
30.0%, p = 1) and after matching (34.2% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.81). No significant 
differences were observed in 3-year relapse-free or local recurrence-free 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: In the matched cohort of mainly intermediate-risk cases, INCT-LCCRT 
and SCRT-CNCT demonstrated comparable CR rates and oncological outcomes.

AIMS: While obesity is linked to increased cancer risk, evidence on the impact 
of intentional weight loss on obesity-associated cancers (OACs) is limited. A 
systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to assess the association 
between intentional weight loss and cancer incidence, including overall cancers 
and 13 OACs, from recent observational studies and clinical trials.
METHODS: Studies published between January 2019 and May 2023 were searched 
within MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Studies assessing the relationship between 
intentional weight loss, defined as weight reduction via metabolic-bariatric 
surgery (MBS) or lifestyle interventions, and cancer incidence were included. A 
dual independent review process was used to screen 1954 abstracts and 84 
full-text articles, and to extract data from 18 full studies. All discrepancies 
were resolved by another reviewer.
RESULTS: Of the 18 studies included, 17 studies were observational, focusing on 
MBS as the method for achieving weight reduction. One randomised controlled 
trial examined the effect of intensive lifestyle intervention on weight 
reduction and found no significant association between intentional weight loss 
and cancer risk. Intentional weight loss was associated with decreased cancer 
incidence in 71.4% (n = 5/7) of studies for all cancers and 66.7% (n = 4/6) of 
studies for OACs, with reported risk reductions of 11% to 33% and 11% to 41%, 
respectively. For specific OACs, a greater number of studies indicated that 
weight reduction was associated with reduced occurrence of endometrial (4/4, 
100%, 31%-53% risk reduction), female breast (5/9, 55.6%, 19%-50% risk 
reduction) and colorectal (4/7, 57.1%, 20%-60% risk reduction) cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: This SLR highlights the potential cancer risk-reduction benefit of 
weight reduction for people with obesity.

Background/Objectives: The dietary modulation of the gut microbiome is a 
promising strategy for mitigating gastrointestinal diseases, such as 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). 
Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, including (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin, 
which have been associated with beneficial effects on gut health and microbiome 
modulation. Importantly, changes in the bacterial populations associated with 
the gut mucosal layer may have different health impacts compared to changes in 
cecal or fecal microbiomes. This study investigated the effects of cocoa 
polyphenol supplementation on microbiome composition across the cecal, fecal, 
and mucosal compartments in a mouse model of colitis. Methods: Mice were fed 
either a healthy AIN93G diet (AIN) or a total Western diet (TWD), with or 
without 2.6% (w/w) CocoaVia™ Cardio Health Powder. Gut microbiomes from the 
cecum, feces, and colon mucosa were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing at three 
time points: pre-, during, and post-colitis. Results: Microbiome composition 
varied substantially by site, with reduced richness and distinct taxa in the 
mucosal layer compared to cecal and fecal communities. The TWD significantly 
altered microbial composition, decreasing species evenness and shifting beta 
diversity. Cocoa polyphenol supplementation modulated microbial communities in a 
site-specific manner, increasing diversity and promoting rare taxa (e.g., 
Monoglobaceae, Eggerthellaceae, and RF39) primarily in cecal and fecal samples. 
Mucosa-associated communities were less responsive. Conclusions: These findings 
underscore the importance of the sampling site in gut microbiome research. Cocoa 
polyphenols exert site-selective effects, particularly in the gut lumen, 
highlighting the importance of considering anatomical context in dietary 
intervention studies aimed at improving gastrointestinal health.

University, Shadadiya, P.O. Box 5969, Safat 13060, Kuwait.

Background/Objectives: Malnutrition is a common but underrecognized complication 
in colorectal cancer (CRC), contributing to poor treatment outcomes and reduced 
quality of life. Regional data from the Gulf remains limited. This study 
assessed the prevalence of malnutrition and nutrition impact symptoms (NISs) 
among CRC patients in Kuwait. It evaluated the diagnostic performance of the 
PG-SGA Short Form (PG-SGA SF) in comparison to the full PG-SGA and the 
Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST). Methods: A cross-sectional study was 
conducted among 65 CRC outpatients at the Kuwait Cancer Control Center. 
Nutritional status was assessed using the full PG-SGA, PG-SGA SF, and MST. 
Dietary intake, anthropometry, biochemical parameters, and NISs were collected. 
Logistic regression identified independent predictors of malnutrition, and the 
performance of the tool was evaluated using kappa statistics and diagnostic 
accuracy metrics. Results: Malnutrition (PG-SGA B/C) was identified in 61.4% of 
patients. Loss of appetite, dry mouth, and nausea were significantly associated 
with malnutrition (p < 0.00385); dry mouth independently predicted malnutrition 
(OR: 17.65, 95% CI: 2.02-154.19, p = 0.009). BMI was not predictive, but reduced 
mid-arm circumference was significantly associated. PG-SGA SF showed strong 
agreement with the full PG-SGA (κ = 0.75), with high sensitivity (87.2%) and 
specificity (88.5%), outperforming MST (κ = 0.38). Only 23.5% of moderately 
malnourished patients were referred to a dietitian. Conclusions: Malnutrition 
and NIS are highly prevalent among Kuwaiti CRC patients. PG-SGA SF is a valid 
and efficient screening tool that should replace MST in oncology settings. 
Symptom-informed screening and structured referral protocols are crucial for 
enhancing nutrition care.

Use of Mechanical Enhanced Colonoscopy to Improve Polyp Detection During 
Colorectal Cancer Screening: A Real-World Healthcare Database Analysis.

Cheloff AZ(1), Gross SA(1).

Author information:
(1)NYU Langone Health, 550 1st Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.

Introduction: High performance colonoscopy requires the monitoring of an 
individual's adenoma detection rate (ADR). The Endocuff (EndoCuff Vision, 
Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA) is an endoscopic distal attachment 
device that increases surface area exposure during colonoscopy. While studies 
have shown that Endocuff increased ADR, real-world data is limited on its 
effectiveness. Methods: The Premiere Health Database was reviewed from 2018 to 
2021 to identify patients 50 years of age or older who had a screening 
colonoscopy. A keyword search for "Endocuff" was used to determine if Endocuff 
was utilized, and ICD10 codes were analyzed to determine if a polyp was found. 
Our primary outcome was a polyp detection rate (PDR) for Endocuff-assisted 
colonoscopy (EAC) and standard colonoscopy (SC). Secondary outcomes included an 
estimated adenoma detection rate (eADR). Logistic regression modeling was 
performed to examine the difference in PDR between the EAC and SC groups after 
controlling for baseline characteristics, insurance type, and provider 
experience. Results: Gastroenterologists performed 893,560 screening 
colonoscopies, of which 0.7% were Endocuff-assisted, while surgeons performed 
234,962 screening colonoscopies and 0.5% were Endocuff-assisted. PDR was higher 
with EAC for both gastroenterologists (72.0% vs. 57.4%) and surgeons (55.6% vs. 
43.7%), with eADR following similar trends. The odds ratio of polyp detection 
with vs. without Endocuff was 1.91 for gastroenterologists and 1.62 for 
surgeons. After adjusting for patient and provider factors, the adjusted odds 
ratios are 2.01 and 1.61, respectively. Conclusions: While Endocuff utilization 
remains low, this large study using real-world data demonstrates the ability to 
improve eADR by over 10% compared to standard colonoscopy.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has emerged as a minimally invasive 
technique for treating early colorectal cancer (CRC), offering the potential for 
en bloc resection and precise histopathological assessment. However, when ESD 
results in non-curative outcomes-characterized by factors such as positive 
margins, deep submucosal invasion, or lymphovascular invasion-salvage surgery 
becomes a critical consideration. This review synthesizes current evidence on 
the indications, timing, surgical approaches, outcomes, and future directions of 
salvage surgery following non-curative ESD in early CRC.

Chronic periodontitis has emerged as a potential modifiable risk factor for 
several tumors, yet its role remains underexplored beyond epidemiological 
associations. This perspective review examines the immunological and molecular 
interplay between periodontitis and various cancers-including prostate, 
colorectal, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and oral potentially malignant 
disorders-highlighting shared inflammatory mediators and immune dysregulation. 
Special attention is given to immune cell profiles, cytokine expression, 
dysbiosis, and common miRNA signatures. Recent evidence suggests that 
periodontitis may act not only as a co-factor in tumor development but also, in 
some contexts, as a marker of therapeutic response, particularly in patients 
undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In our view, future research 
should prioritize mechanistic studies to define common immune-inflammatory 
pathways and clarify whether periodontitis functions as a field cancerization 
process or as a facilitator of malignant transformation in already compromised 
tissues. The relationship between cancer and periodontitis underscores the need 
to integrate oral health into oncologic care and immunotherapy management.

Background/Objectives: Colorectal surgeons continue to care for an aging cancer 
population with increasing comorbidities and frailty. Frailty, characterized by 
a systemic physiologic decline associated with aging, is an increasingly popular 
focus in surgical outcomes research. This retrospective study investigates how 
frailty impacts outcomes in the octogenarian and nonagenarian populations 
undergoing surgical treatment for colon cancer. Methods: Data from the National 
Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) colectomy-targeted variables 
dataset from 2015 to 2021 were utilized for this analysis, including patients 80 
years of age and older. Frailty was assessed using the five-factor modified 
frailty index (mFI-5). The study examined post-operative outcomes across frailty 
groups in this population. Results: From 2015-2021, there were 10,671 patients 
aged 80 years and older who underwent colectomy for colon cancer, of whom 1259 
(11.8%) were 90 years or older and 2844 (26.7%) were severely frail. Frailty 
significantly impacted post-operative colectomy outcomes in this population. On 
univariate analysis, frail patients had higher rates of pneumonia (p = 0.015), 
unplanned intubation (p = 0.012), stroke (p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (p = 
0.011), readmission (p < 0.001), long length of stay (p < 0.001), and mortality 
(p < 0.001) compared to non-frail patients. On multivariate analysis, severe 
frailty (mFI-5 of 2 or more) was associated with an increased odds of unplanned 
intubation (aOR 2.41, 95% CI 1.27-4.59), long length of stay (aOR 1.73, 95% CI 
1.44-2.09), readmission (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.42-2.39), and mortality (aOR 1.95, 
95% CI 1.20-3.15) compared to non-frail patients. Conclusions: Frailty plays a 
critical role in influencing the outcomes of octogenarians and nonagenarians 
undergoing colectomy for colon cancer within the NSQIP dataset. Future work 
should investigate whether addressing frailty prior to surgery in this 
population can improve patients' post-operative courses.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with an elevated risk of colorectal cancer 
(CRC), driven by chronic inflammation and a distinct 
inflammation-dysplasia-carcinoma pathway. Conventional surveillance relies on 
colonoscopy and histologic assessment, but flat, multifocal dysplasia and 
sampling limitations challenge early detection. Tissue-based biomarkers offer 
promise in improving risk stratification and identifying patients at high risk 
for UC-associated CRC (UC-CRC). This review explores key categories of tissue 
biomarkers with potential clinical utility, including genetic mutations, 
epigenetic alterations, microRNA expression profiles, and markers of genomic 
instability such as telomere shortening, copy number variants, and aneuploidy. 
Many of these molecular alterations precede histologic dysplasia and reflect a 
"field effect," suggesting their potential role in early cancer detection. 
Despite compelling associations between these biomarkers and neoplastic 
progression, most lack prospective validation and are not yet ready for routine 
clinical use. Future research should prioritize the development of integrated 
biomarker panels and validate their predictive accuracy in longitudinal UC 
cohorts. Molecular profiling may ultimately enable personalized, risk-adapted 
surveillance strategies that improve early detection while minimizing 
unnecessary interventions.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 
conventional CT values and the dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)-derived 
effective atomic number (Zeff), fat fraction (FF) and iodine concentration (IC) 
for the differentiation of hypodense liver lesions in patients with colorectal 
cancer (CRC). Methods: One hundred and twenty patients (mean age: 65 ± 12 years) 
affected by CRC who underwent dual-source DECT as part of tumor staging between 
December 2015 and June 2023 were retrospectively evaluated. Spectral datasets 
were reconstructed for each patient and regions of interest were applied at the 
level of hypodense liver lesions to collect CT, Zeff, FF and IC values. To 
assess diagnostic accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 
constructed to evaluate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and 
specificity using biopsy or MRI (in cases when biopsy was not indicated or 
feasible) as a reference standard. The Youden index was used to identify optimal 
cut-off values for potential clinical applications. Results: A total of 223 
lesions (147 metastases and 76 cysts) were evaluated. CT, FF and IC values 
differed significantly between metastases and cysts (p < 0.0001), showing high 
diagnostic accuracy. FF showed significantly higher diagnostic accuracy compared 
to all other parameters (all p ≤ 0.0074), with an AUC value of 0.97 (95% CI: 
0.94-0.99). For a cut-off > 15.9, the sensitivity reached 91.8% (95% CI: 
86.2-95.7) and the specificity reached 98.7% (95% CI: 92.9-100). Zeff numbers 
did not differ considerably (p = 0.781) between the two entities and 
demonstrated a lower AUC (0.511; 95% CI: 0.44-0.58). Conclusions: FF 
measurements proved to have high diagnostic accuracy compared to CT values, IC, 
and Zeff in the evaluation of hypodense liver lesions in patients suffering from 
colorectal carcinoma.

Potential of Selected C-X-C Motif Chemokines as Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer 
Diagnosis.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and 
mortality worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis and high metastatic potential. 
Effective management requires accurate diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic 
strategies, with growing focus on molecular biomarkers. Chemokines, which are 
small, secreted proteins regulating immune cell migration and tissue 
homeostasis, shape the tumor microenvironment by promoting tumor growth, 
angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. In CRC, the expression of altered 
chemokine-receptor profiles correlates with progression and clinical outcomes. 
Chemokines are classified by the presence or absence of the ELR motif, which 
differentiates CXC subgroups. Selection focused on those consistently altered in 
CRC tissues or serum and involved in key oncogenic processes. CXCL1 and its 
receptor CXCR2 are overexpressed and linked to tumor progression, highlighting 
their diagnostic and therapeutic potential. CXCL8 is elevated in tissues and 
serum, correlating with metastasis and poor survival. The CXCL12/CXCR4/CXCR7 
axis drives metastasis. CXCL13 promotes immune evasion via CXCR5, while CXCL14 
is downregulated, suggesting a protective role. Moreover, CXCL16 associates with 
worse outcomes, whereas CXCR6 may enhance immunotherapy response. Overall, 
chemokines and receptors are promising blood biomarkers and therapeutic targets 
in CRC. Further validation is needed using large prospective studies, 
standardized assays, and multi-marker approaches to establish their potential as 
non-invasive CRC biomarkers.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest and most frequently occurring 
cancers worldwide. Often diagnosed in advanced stages, it requires more 
challenging treatment. However, emerging studies highlight the possible role of 
microRNAs (miRNAs) in the screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of CRC. MiRNAs 
modulate gene expression and can play both roles in tumor suppressors and 
oncogenes. In CRC, they influence epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell 
proliferation and migration, apoptosis, autophagy, and patients' treatment 
response. In clinical applications, they can be used as predictive and 
prognostic biomarkers as well as for matching the most suitable treatments. 
Despite its growing popularity, there is still much to discover about their 
potential usage in medicine.

Lateral Spreading Tumors (LSTs) are a type of non-polypoid lesion known for 
their flat morphology, which often leads to them going undetected. However, 
especially nongranular (NG) LSTs have the potential for malignant 
transformation. Recent advances in endoscopic technologies have improved the 
detection of these lesions. Despite growing research interest in their role in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) development, a comprehensive molecular characterization 
of LSTs is still lacking. The aim of this review is to highlight the current 
knowledge of the molecular characteristics of LSTs, that may help in determining 
whether LSTs can be prognostic indicators and identifying cases where they may 
rapidly progress to CRC through characteristic molecular pathways. From a 
mutational point of view, LSTs seem to be more closely associated with 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) than with polypoid lesions. Nonetheless, they 
have peculiar epigenetic and genetic traits, which set them apart from other 
adenomas or bowel diseases. Elucidating their role in CRC development would 
provide benefits for their classification and management, by enhancing clinical 
surveillance strategies for patients diagnosed with these lesions in order to 
improve the efficient prevention of colorectal cancer.

Comparison of Current Immunotherapy Approaches and Novel Anti-Cancer Vaccine 
Modalities for Clinical Application.

Sligo, Ireland.

Despite improved diagnostic and treatment protocols, cancer remains a leading 
cause of morbidity and mortality globally. There are increasing rates of certain 
cancer types, including the highly drug-resistant colorectal cancer, in younger 
population cohorts. Therapeutic advances in oncology have led to the application 
of immunotherapy-based agents, including checkpoint inhibitors, antibodies, and 
adoptive cell therapies. Such immunotherapy approaches are greatly hindered by 
the tumour microenvironment and lack of specificity. Therapeutic vaccines are an 
innovative and rapidly advancing area of oncology, having potential for 
application as mono- and combined therapy in clinical settings, offering long 
term efficacy against disease recurrence. Advances in vaccine production using 
gene editing and bioprocessing techniques allows for novel vaccine types, 
including protein-based subunit vaccines, virus-like particle vaccines, and 
viral vector- and nucleic acid-based (RNA and DNA) vaccines. Cancer vaccines are 
designed to deliver specific tumour antigens, which activate anti-cancer 
cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells to produce immune memory, providing long 
term anti-cancer action. When coupled with advances in machine learning and 
artificial intelligence, anti-cancer vaccines may revolutionise oncology 
protocols and improve patient prognosis. This review aims to discuss current 
immunotherapy options in cancer treatment and recent advances in anti-cancer 
vaccine modalities.

Down-Regulation of Oncogene c-myb Specifically by Carbazole Derivative Through 
Opposing Effects on Different Quadruplex Structures of Gene Promoter for Cancer 
Treatment.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of human mortality worldwide, and aberrant 
expression of the c-myb oncogene is closely associated with the development of 
numerous malignancies. The c-myb promoter region contains G-rich and C-rich 
sequences capable of forming G-quadruplex (G4) and i-motif (IM or C-quadruplex) 
structures, respectively. These secondary structures function as "molecular 
switches" for gene transcriptional regulation and represent promising targets 
for novel anti-tumor therapeutics. Through extensive screening, we identified 
carbazole derivative G51 as a unique dual-targeting ligand that simultaneously 
destabilized the i-motif and stabilized the G-quadruplex, consequently 
suppressing c-myb expression efficiently. In comparison, the single-targeting 
ligand G50, which could specifically bind to and unfold the G-quadruplex only, 
exhibited significantly weaker anti-tumor activity than G51. Notably, G51 showed 
potent anti-tumor efficacy in a human colorectal cancer xenograft model without 
significant toxicity to vital organs. G51, as a dual-targeting ligand, had 
specific binding to c-myb promoter quadruplexes, with destabilization of the 
i-motif and concurrent stabilization of the G-quadruplex. This opposing effect 
could provide a good opportunity for specific gene regulation, with great 
potential for further development of a precise therapeutic agent. This study 
provides a novel example for a practical therapeutic approach through 
coordinated gene quadruplex modulations, which sets up a good foundation for 
developing high-efficacy anti-tumor drugs without significant side effects.

We report the synthesis and characterization of folic acid (FA)-conjugated human 
serum albumin nanoparticles, (HSA-FA):Ru NPs, as targeted carriers for rutin 
(Ru), a flavonoid with known anticancer activity. Nanoparticles were fabricated 
via a desolvation method, and their surface was functionalized with folic acid 
to promote selective uptake by cancer cells overexpressing folate receptors. 
Morphological and dimensional analyses performed by atomic force microscopy 
(AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fluorescence microscopy confirmed 
that all nanoparticles were below 100 nm and exhibited good colloidal stability. 
Voltametric measurements confirmed the successful incorporation of both rutin 
and folic acid within the (HSA-FA):Ru nanoparticle formulation. Biological 
evaluation was conducted on healthy L929 fibroblasts and HT-29 colon 
adenocarcinoma cells. MTS colorimetric assays revealed that (HSA-FA):Ru NPs 
significantly reduced the viability of HT-29 cells, while maintaining higher 
compatibility with L929 cells. Fluorescence and electron microscopy further 
confirmed preferential nanoparticle uptake and surface accumulation in HT-29 
cells, supporting the role of folic acid in enhancing targeted delivery. The 
study demonstrates that HSA-based nanoparticles functionalized with FA and 
loaded with Ru offer a biocompatible and efficient strategy for selective 
intracellular drug delivery in colorectal cancer. These findings support the use 
of albumin-based nanocarriers in the development of targeted therapeutic 
platforms for cancer treatment.

Increased drug metabolism and elimination are prominent mechanisms mediating 
multidrug resistance (MDR) to not only chemotherapy drugs but also anti-cancer 
natural products, such as benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC). To evaluate the 
possibility of combined utilization of a certain compound to overcome this 
resistance, we focused on glutathione S-transferase (GST)-dependent metabolism 
of BITC. The pharmacological treatment of a pi-class GST-selective inhibitor, 
6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-ylthio)hexanol (NBDHEX), significantly 
increased BITC-induced toxicity in human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells. 
However, NBDHEX unexpectedly increased the level of the BITC-glutathione (GSH) 
conjugate as well as BITC-modified proteins, suggesting that NBDHEX might 
increase BITC-modified protein accumulation by inhibiting BITC-GSH excretion 
instead of inhibiting GST. Furthermore, NBDHEX significantly potentiated 
BITC-induced apoptosis with the enhanced activation of apoptosis-related 
pathways, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase and caspase-3 pathways. These results 
suggested that combination treatment with NBDHEX may be an effective way to 
overcome MDR with drug efflux and thus induce the biological activity of BITC at 
lower doses.

The Wntβ-catenin signaling pathway is a key regulator of gastrointestinal (GI) 
tumorigenesis, modulating cellular processes such as proliferation, 
differentiation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this review, 
we evaluate the expression and mutation profiles of core Wntpathway components 
in the most common GI malignancies. Our findings outline notable alterations in 
ligands, receptors, co-receptors, and intracellular effectors across different 
GI cancers. In gastric cancer tissue, elevated levels of Wnt proteins, FZD7 
receptor, and LRP5/6, along with β-catenin accumulation and reduced APC 
expression, are associated with poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer samples, 
common APC mutations and Wnt ligand overexpression contribute to β-catenin 
nuclear localization and EMT. Esophageal cancer specimens exhibit 
co-overexpression of Wnt2 and Wnt5A, as well as receptors such as FZD2 and FZD6, 
which are linked to worse prognosis and reduced survival. Liver cancer tissue 
commonly harbors CTNNB1 mutations, which encode β-catenin and are associated 
with poor differentiation. In pancreatic cancer samples, overexpression of Wnt 
ligands, FZD receptors, and β-catenin is associated with the presence of distant 
metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. In conclusion, this pathway represents a 
promising avenue for identifying novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic 
biomarkers in GI cancers, warranting further clinical investigation.

Significant efforts have been dedicated to developing controlled-release systems 
for the effective management of colorectal cancer. In this study, a once-daily, 
delayed-release regorafenib (REG) tablet was fabricated using 3D printing 
technology for the treatment of colorectal cancer. For this, a hydrogel 
containing 80 mg of the drug in a matrix of hyaluronic acid, carboxymethyl 
cellulose, Pluronic F127, and glycerol was prepared to incorporate into the 
shell cavity of tablet via a pressure-assisted microsyringe (PAM). The shell was 
printed from an optimized ink formulation of Soluplus®, Eudragit® RS-100, corn 
starch 1500, propylene glycol 4000, and talc through melt extrusion-based 3D 
printing. In vitro release assays showed a drug release rate of 91.1% in the 
phosphate buffer medium at 8 h and only 8.5% in the acidic medium. Drug release 
kinetics followed a first-order model. The results showed smooth and uniform 
layers based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and drug stability at 135 °C 
upon TGA. FTIR analysis confirmed the absence of undesired covalent interactions 
between the materials. Weight variation and assay results complied with USP 
standards. Mechanical strength testing revealed a Young's modulus of 5.18 MPa 
for the tablets. Overall, these findings demonstrate that 3D printing technology 
enables the precise fabrication of delayed-release REG tablets, offering 
controlled-release kinetics and accurate dosing tailored for patients in 
intensive care units.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, 
with liver metastasis being the leading cause of mortality. De novo fatty acid 
synthesis plays a critical role in CRC progression and metastasis. Bufalin, a 
cardiotonic steroid isolated from toad skin, has demonstrated anticancer 
activity in multiple preclinical models. However, the mechanisms underlying its 
suppression of CRC metastasis and modulation of fatty acid synthesis remain to 
be elucidated.
METHODS: The effects of bufalin on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and 
apoptosis were assessed via colony formation, wound healing, and flow cytometry 
assays. Transcriptome analysis identified bufalin-affected pathways, with 
changes in gene and protein expression. FASN protein levels were quantified 
using ELISA.
RESULTS: Bufalin inhibited proliferation and migration of CRC cells and induced 
the apoptosis of LoVo and HCT8 cells. Transcriptome analysis highlighted lipid 
metabolism pathways as potential mediators of bufalin's anti-metastatic 
activity. Notably, bufalin reduced the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) 
and suppressed CRC metastasis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that bufalin 
attenuated CRC progression and liver metastasis by inhibiting de novo fatty acid 
synthesis through the PI3K/AKT-mediated SREBP1/FASN pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Bufalin inhibits de novo fatty acid synthesis via the 
PI3K/AKT-mediated SREBP1/FASN pathway, suppressing CRC progression and liver 
metastasis.

Combining Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning to Predict Drug Resistance 
Causing Variants of BRAF in Colorectal Cancer.

The BRAF protein regulates cell growth and division through key signaling 
pathways. Mutations in BRAF, particularly the V600E variant, are frequently 
observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and are associated with poor prognosis and 
therapeutic challenges. Tumors harboring certain BRAF mutations often exhibit 
primary resistance to BRAF inhibitor monotherapies. Over time, these tumors can 
also develop acquired resistance, further complicating treatment. In this study, 
we employed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations combined with 
machine learning techniques to investigate the structural alterations induced by 
BRAF mutations and their contribution to drug resistance. Our analyses revealed 
that conformational changes in mutant BRAF proteins associated with dabrafenib 
residues psi494, phi600, phi644, phi663, psi675, and phi677 were sufficient for 
classifying drug-resistant vs. drug-sensitive variants. Similarly, for 
vemurafenib, residues psi450, phi484, phi495, phi518, psi622, and phi622 were 
the key residues that influence drug binding and resistance mechanisms. These 
residues are located in the N-lobe of CR3, which is responsible for ATP binding 
and the regulation of BRAF kinase activity. These findings offer deeper insights 
into the molecular basis of BRAF-driven resistance and provide predictive models 
for phenotypic outcomes of various BRAF mutations. The study underscores the

In the era of precision medicine, liquid biopsy has become an indispensable tool 
in research and clinical diagnostics. This innovative molecular approach offers 
significant benefits in managing cancers, such as melanoma, colorectal cancer, 
lung cancer, and, now, head and neck tumors. By addressing the challenges posed 
by tumor heterogeneity, liquid biopsy aligns seamlessly with precision medicine 
strategies, providing more accessible methods to detect and monitor genetic 
alterations in tumors. While biomarkers for head and neck tumors have been 
identified, integrating these markers into diagnostic workflows remains a 
challenge due to the complexities of current sampling techniques. Could liquid 
biopsy pave the way for a breakthrough in the diagnosis, monitoring, and 
treatment of patients with head and neck cancer? This review explores the 
expanding role of liquid biopsy in oncology, with a focus on its potential to 
revolutionize the management of head and neck malignancies. Liquid biopsy has 
become an integral part of diagnosis, classification, and prognostication of 
numerous cancers, namely, head and neck tumors. Liquid biopsy should work in 
concert with histological testing, imaging, surgery, and other diagnostic and 
therapeutic approaches, as each offers distinct advantages that together 
contribute to achieving the best possible patient outcomes.

Background: Early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) are key 
goals of population-based screening. Several diagnostic tests have been proposed 
for CRC screening. This study compares the diagnostic accuracy of colon capsule 
endoscopy (CCE), colonoscopy (COL) and computed tomographic colonography (CTC), 
focusing on risk factors such as polyps. Methods: We conducted a systematic 
review with meta-analyses and network meta-analysis. Pooled estimates of 
sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative 
predictive value (NPV) were calculated using a random-effects model. Diagnostic 
performance was assessed for first- and second-level screening based on effect 
size estimates. Results: For first-level screening, sensitivity was 0.79 (95% 
CI: 0.60-0.91) and specificity 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88-0.98); PPV and NPV were 0.89 
and 0.97, respectively. In second-level screening, sensitivity was 0.75 (95% CI: 
0.65-0.83), specificity 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.97), PPV 0.76 and NPV 0.95. The 
indirect sensitivity estimate of CCE vs. COL (SMD = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.12-0.47) was 
lower than the direct estimate for CTC (SMD = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.29-0.59). CCE 
showed better comparative performance than CTC relative to COL (CCE SMD = -0.18; 
95% CI: -0.29 to -0.06 vs. CTC SMD = -0.98; 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.90). However, 
both CCE and CTC had lower specificity than COL. Conclusions: CCE represents a 
valuable tool for early CRC detection. Test selection should be guided by 
clinical and epidemiological settings to optimize screening strategies.

Background/Objectives: Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency assessment has proven to 
be a valuable tool for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic management guidance 
in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Our study aimed to investigate the 
associations between MMR deficiency and a range of clinicopathological 
parameters. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study including 
264 patients diagnosed with CRC, for whom immunohistochemical (IHC) data were 
available. Statistical analysis was performed using the Python 3.12.7 
programming language within the Jupyter Notebook environment (Anaconda 
distribution). Results: MMR deficiency was identified in 18.18% of patients. It 
was significantly associated with younger age (<50 years), female sex, 
right-sided tumor location, poor tumor differentiation (G3), smoking, and loss 
of CDX2 expression (p < 0.001). MLH1 and PMS2 were the most frequently affected 
proteins, with concurrent loss in 77.08% of MMR-deficient cases. Loss of MLH1 
expression correlated with female sex (p = 0.004), right-sided location (p < 
0.001), poor differentiation (p < 0.001), and loss of CDX2 expression (p < 
0.001). Additionally, the loss of PMS2 expression was associated with female sex 
(p = 0.015), right-sided tumor location (p = 0.003), and poor differentiation (p 
< 0.001). No significant associations were identified between MMR status and 
tumor stage, histological subtype, PLR, or NLR values. Conclusions: Gaining 
deeper insights into the clinical relevance of MMR status in CRC could 
contribute to improved testing rates and support the design of tailored 
management strategies that address the specific biological features of these 
tumors.

Background: A significant body of research has identified ongoing unmet needs 
among cancer survivors. However, there is limited information about the 
survivorship experiences of patients in low- and middle-income countries. This 
study examined the experiences of colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors in Thailand 
to understand their post-treatment needs and priorities. Methods: A qualitative 
descriptive study using semi-structured interviews was conducted with 24 
colorectal cancer survivors purposively recruited from a large university 
hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. The interviews lasted 60-90 min, were 
audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The data were analyzed using hybrid 
content analysis, guided by the five domains of the Survivors Unmet Needs Survey 
(SUNS): information, emotional health, financial concerns, access and continuity 
of care, and relationships. Results: Participants had a mean age of 57 (SD = 
10.9) years. Most were male (58.3%) and diagnosed at a late stage (62.5%). All 
participants had undergone surgical treatment, and the average time since 
treatment completion was approximately 3.85 (SD = 2.8) years. Participants most 
often reported unmet needs in the information and emotional health domains. They 
also described inadequate physical infrastructure (e.g., overcrowded clinic 
spaces) and minimal involvement of multidisciplinary providers. Despite these 
challenges, survivors expressed strong trust in physicians and a preference for 
physician-led care. Telehealth was viewed as a potential solution to reduce 
access barriers and improve continuity of care. Conclusions: Guided by the SUNS 
framework, this study identified significant unmet needs among colorectal cancer 
survivors in Thailand, particularly in health information, psychological 
support, and care system infrastructure. Strengthening health information 
delivery, establishing dedicated survivorship clinics, and exploring scalable 
care models supported by telehealth could help bridge these gaps and promote 
more equitable survivorship care in low-resource settings.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cancer is a major public health burden in Serbia and a 
factor influencing long-term disaster readiness by straining health system 
capacity. This study examined spatial and temporal trends in incidence and 
mortality for eight major cancers among women in Central Serbia (1999-2021) to 
inform targeted prevention and preparedness strategies.
METHODS: Standardised rates from national datasets were analysed using the 
Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope estimator. Geographic disparities were 
mapped in ArcGIS Pro 3.2. Mortality trends were assessed only for statistically 
reliable series.
RESULTS: Breast cancer incidence increased in six counties, while cervical 
cancer declined in several areas, likely reflecting screening success. 
Colorectal, bladder, pancreatic, and lung and bronchus cancers showed rising 
incidence; lung and bronchus cancer mortality increased in 16 counties, 
indicating growing demand for chronic respiratory care. These shifts may reduce 
surge capacity during disasters by increasing the baseline burden on healthcare 
infrastructure. Regional disparities highlight uneven system resilience.
CONCLUSIONS: Aligning cancer control measures-especially for high-burden cancers 
like lung-with emergency preparedness frameworks is essential to strengthen 
health system resilience, particularly in resource-limited regions.

Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) is emerging as a significant global health 
concern, particularly among individuals under the age of 50. This alarming trend 
has coincided with an increase in the consumption of processed foods that often 
rely heavily on synthetic preservatives. At the same time, these additives play 
a critical role in ensuring food safety and shelf life. Growing evidence 
suggests that they may contribute to adverse gut health outcomes, which is a 
known risk factor in colorectal cancer development. At the same time, synthetic 
preservatives serve essential roles such as preventing microbial spoilage, 
maintaining color, and prolonging shelf life. Natural preservatives, on the 
other hand, not only provide antimicrobial protection but also exhibit 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These contrasting functions form 
the basis of current discussions on their safety and health implications. 
Despite their widespread use, the long-term health implications of synthetic 
preservatives remain inadequately understood. This review synthesizes recent 
clinical, epidemiological, mechanistic, and toxicological data to examine the 
potential link between synthetic food preservatives and EOCRC. Particular focus 
is placed on compounds that have been associated with DNA damage, gut microbiota 
disruption, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation, which are the mechanisms 
that collectively increase cancer risk. In contrast, natural preservatives 
derived from plants and microbes are gaining attention for their antioxidant, 
antimicrobial, and possible anti-inflammatory effects. While these alternatives 
show promise, scientific validation and regulatory approval remain limited. This 
review highlights the urgent need for more rigorous, long-term human studies and 
advocates for enhanced regulatory oversight. It advocates for a 
multidisciplinary approach to developing safer preservation strategies and 
highlights the importance of public education in making informed dietary 
choices. Natural preservatives, though still under investigation, may offer a 
safer path forward in mitigating EOCRC risk and shaping future food and health 
policies.

Fermentation represents a sustainable biotechnological approach for enhancing 
bioactive properties of plant-based foods, yet its anticancer effects remain 
underexplored. We evaluated the antiproliferative activity of fermented (with 
commercial probiotic lactic acid bacteria consortium) and unfermented 
plant-based beverages derived from tiger nut, carob, and rice using an in vitro 
model. Following INFOGEST 2.0 gastrointestinal digestion, bioaccessible 
fractions were applied to Caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells at 1:15 v/v 
dilution for 24 h. Analyses included cell viability, apoptosis detection, cell 
cycle distribution, reactive oxygen species production, glutathione content, 
mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular calcium levels. Fermented 
tiger nut achieved superior (p < 0.05) cytotoxicity compared to unfermented 
counterpart (39.6% vs. 77.4% cell viability) through dual mechanisms: depleting 
cellular antioxidant defenses (glutathione reduced to 55.9%) while inducing 
oxidative stress (180.3% ROS overproduction). This evoked irreversible apoptosis 
(76.9% early apoptosis) and extensive DNA fragmentation (84.8% SubG1 population) 
via calcium-independent pathways. Fermented carob operated through cytostatic 
mechanisms, inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (74.7% vs. 44.2% in blank digestion 
cells) without oxidative stress. Fermentation reduced (p < 0.05) rice beverage 
antiproliferative activity (90.2% vs. 71.9% unfermented beverage cell 
viability). These findings establish lactic acid fermentation as effective for 
developing plant-based beverages with anticancer mechanisms, offering dietary 
strategies for colorectal cancer prevention.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers, accounting for 
approximately 10% of all new cancer cases globally. An increasing number of 
studies have revealed that the gut microbiome is strongly associated with the 
pathogenesis and progression of CRC. Based on these advances, this review 
delineates the mechanistic links between specific microbes and CRC, as well as 
emerging food-related nutritional intervention strategies. In vivo and in vitro 
studies have pinpointed the implications of key microbes such as Fusobacterium 
nucleatum, certain strains of Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides 
fragilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, among others, and metabolite involvement 
and immune responses. Particular attention is paid to the roles of intratumoral 
microbiota in the development and treatment of CRC, given their direct 
interaction with tumor cells. Various food-related nutritional intervention 
strategies have been developed to mitigate CRC risk, including probiotics, 
antibiotics, or the administration of bioactive compounds such as luteoloside. 
Finally, we outline critical research directions regarding the influence of 
animal lineage, carcinoma location, population demographics, the application of 
advanced in vitro models, and the mediatory roles of gut-associated epithelial 
cells. In summary, this review might consolidate our current knowledge on the 
contribution of gut microbiota to CRC and highlights the microbe-based 
strategies to enhance nutritional interventions for this disease.

BACKGROUND: The potential benefits of prehabilitation in patients undergoing 
surgery for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or upper-tract urothelial carcinoma 
(UTUC) remain unknown. The aim was to evaluate physical function and baseline 
characteristics over the course of treatment to identify a potential need for 
prehabilitation.
METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 62 patients were enrolled-31 
undergoing nephrectomies for RCC and 31 undergoing nephroureterectomy for UTUC. 
Baseline assessments included nutritional screening (NRS 2002), frailty 
(Clinical Frailty Scale), hemoglobin and iron levels, smoking status, and 
physical function using the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and the 30-Second 
Sit-to-Stand Test (30STS). Functional tests were repeated at hospital discharge 
and at two-week postoperative follow-up visit.
RESULTS: At baseline, 45% of RCC and 68% of UTUC patients were at nutritional 
risk. Preoperative frailty was present in 20% of the cohort, and 53% had anemia. 
Functional impairment below the lower limit values (LLVs) was observed in 16% 
for the RCC and 36% of the UTUC, assessed by 6MWT. The 30 STS revealed that 58% 
of RCC and 42% of UTUC were below LLV. At discharge, impairment peaked, with 59% 
and 82% of patients being below the LLVs, respectively. Functional performance 
partially recovered at follow-up but did not return to baseline levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative nutritional deficits, anemia, and functional 
impairment are prevalent in patients undergoing nephrectomy or 
nephroureterectomy. A marked postoperative functional decline was identified 
postoperatively supporting a potential need for early individualized 
prehabilitation strategies to improve recovery in patients undergoing kidney 
cancer surgery.

The Role of Perceived Benefits in Buffering Gastrointestinal-Symptom Burden 
Among Post-Operative Colorectal Cancer Patients: A Six-Month Longitudinal Study.

Objectives: The goal of this longitudinal study was to explore how 
gastrointestinal-symptom distress and benefit finding together influence 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) over time in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
survivors. Colorectal cancer (CRC) survivorship may differ from other cancer 
types due to the persistent burden of gastrointestinal symptoms. The highly 
visible and socially sensitive nature of these sequelae may influence the 
trajectory of benefit finding compared with other cancers. Specifically, we 
explored whether increases in symptom distress predicted declines in physical 
and mental HRQOL whether benefit finding was directly related to or buffered the 
negative impact of symptom distress on HRQOL. Methods: Participants were 73 
Taiwanese women and men who underwent surgery for CRC. Using a three-time-point, 
multilevel framework, participants were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after 
surgery. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to investigate whether 
gastrointestinal-symptom distress and benefit finding covary over time with 
HRQOL. Results: The results indicated that increases in gastrointestinal-symptom 
distress were linked to declines in both physical and mental HRQOL. Benefit 
finding had no direct association with HRQOL but significantly moderated the 
symptom-HRQOL relationship, weakening the negative impact of symptom distress 
among those with higher benefit finding. Conclusions: Rises in a CRC survivor's 
gastrointestinal-symptom distress went hand-in-hand with drops in both physical 
and mental HRQOL. This study adds to the literature in that benefit finding has 
a favorable effect on cancer adjustment when patients face higher symptom 
distress after the surgery and treatment. Further implications on possible 
mechanisms were discussed.

BACKGROUND: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has transformed the 
treatment of hematological malignancies, yet its application in solid tumors 
remains constrained by unique biological and logistical barriers.
OBJECTIVE: This review critically examines the evolving landscape of CAR T-cell 
therapy in solid malignancies, with a focus on antigen heterogeneity, the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and risks of on-target, off-tumor 
toxicity.
METHODS: We outline recent advances in CAR engineering, including co-stimulatory 
optimization, dual- and multi-antigen targeting, armored CARs, and gene-edited 
constructs designed to enhance persistence and anti-tumor activity. Clinical 
progress is highlighted by recent FDA approvals of genetically modified T-cell 
therapies in synovial sarcoma and melanoma, underscoring the potential for 
broader solid tumor application. Additionally, we synthesize early-phase 
clinical trial findings across multiple solid tumor types (e.g., lung, 
colorectal, ovarian, glioblastoma), and discuss innovative approaches such as 
regional delivery, checkpoint blockade combinations, and incorporation of 
chemokine receptors for improved tumor infiltration. The review also considers 
future strategies, including artificial intelligence-guided target discovery and 
rational trial design to overcome translational bottlenecks.
CONCLUSIONS: With expanding clinical experience and continued technological 
innovation, CAR T-cell therapy is steadily transitioning from an experimental 
strategy to a therapeutic reality in solid tumors, poised to reshape the future 
of cancer immunotherapy.

Objectives: We sought to document interim methodologic improvements and 
preliminary results for pulmonary suffusion. Methods: A Phase I/II trial of 
thoracoscopic lung suffusion for resectable sarcoma and colorectal carcinoma 
metastases followed a pilot study on oligometastatic lung malignancy at a 
comprehensive cancer center. Primary-specific chemotherapy doses (cisplatin, 
oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, or gemcitabine) suffused unilaterally for 30 min were 
escalated to amplify regional deliveries three-fold. Drug delivery was measured 
with tissue, blood samples, and 99Tc; pulmonary function tests and clinical 
adverse events (AEs) assessed safety and tolerance. Results: From 2008-2025, 31 
ECOG 0-2 patients (10 male) aged 33-75 years had unilateral lung suffusion (16 
right, 14 left, 1 aborted, and 8 sides selected randomly). Vascular occlusion 
intolerance was immediate or delayed (25 min) in two cases. Two 
catheter-positioning grade 3 AEs occurred: hypotension with troponin leak (1) 
and atrial fibrillation (1). Patients averaged 1.3 ± 1.2 metastasectomies (17 
sub-lobar, 8 lobar resections, and 2 intentional open cytoreductive 
metastasectomies). Hospitalizations were brief (1-4 days) except for 6-7 day 
stays in the only two open cases and one doxorubicin (grade 4 hypoxic 
respiratory failure) case. Ninety-day survival was 100%, and the Phase I 
delivery goal of 12.75 mg/m2 65 (15% systemic) was achieved for oxaliplatin. 
Lung function was preserved according to 99Tc differentials within 6.1 ± 7.1% of 
the predicted reductions at 30 days. Sampling delays, tracer discordances, and 
atypical pharmacokinetics reduced tissue drug detections. Recent pulmonary 
artery snaring cases (two) demonstrated in-flow control more stable than that of 
balloon occlusions. Conclusions: Suffusion for metastatic malignancies appears 
safe and warrants further investigation.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The incidence of early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) is 
increasing globally, particularly among underrepresented populations such as 
Hispanic/Latino individuals. TP53 is among the most frequently mutated pathways 
in CRC; however, its role in EOCRC, especially in relation to disparities and 
treatment outcomes, remains poorly defined. We developed AI-HOPE-TP53, a novel 
conversational AI agent, to enable a real-time, disparity-aware analysis of TP53 
pathway alterations in EOCRC.
METHODS: AI-HOPE-TP53 integrates a fine-tuned biomedical large language model 
(LLaMA 3) with harmonized datasets from cBioPortal (TCGA, MSK-IMPACT, AACR 
Project GENIE). Natural language queries are translated into workflows for 
mutation profiling, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and odds ratio estimation 
across clinical and demographic subgroups.
RESULTS: The platform replicated known genotype-phenotype associations, 
including elevated TP53 mutation frequency in EOCRC and poorer prognosis in 
TP53-mutated tumors. Significant findings included a survival benefit for 
patients with early-onset TP53-mutant CRC treated with FOLFOX (p = 0.0149). 
Additional exploratory analyses showed a trend toward higher prevalence of TP53 
pathway alterations in Hispanic/Latino EOCRC patients (OR = 2.13, p = 0.084) and 
identified sex-based disparities in treatment, with women being less likely than 
men to receive FOLFOX (OR = 0.845, p = 0.0138).
CONCLUSIONS: AI-HOPE-TP53, developed in this study and made publicly available, 
is the first conversational AI platform tailored for pathway-specific and 
disparity-aware EOCRC research. By integrating clinical, genomic, and 
demographic data through natural language interaction, hypothesis generation and 
equity-focused analyses are enabled, with significant potential to advance 
precision oncology.

Background/Objectives: Psychosocial factors are not routinely screened for 
during the perioperative period, even though they significantly influence 
overall health. This study aimed to inventory the psychosocial vulnerabilities 
among patients undergoing cancer surgery. Methods: We conducted a 
cross-sectional analysis of a researcher-administered psychosocial screener 
implemented within a statewide health system between July 2023 and August 2025. 
A 45 min screener was offered to consecutive adult patients within two weeks 
before their major elective cancer surgery. Residential addresses were geocoded 
to assign neighborhood deprivation percentiles for the Area Deprivation Index 
(ADI) and the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Elevated psychosocial 
vulnerability was determined based on a model-based clustering approach, and a 
high deprivation index was defined as ≥75th percentile. Results: A total of 383 
patients (37% response rate) completed the screener, including colorectal (40%), 
thoracic (36%), and surgical oncology (24%) patients, with a median age of 66 
years (IQR, 57-73). Over half (52.0%, n = 199) reported ≥2 psychological and ≥2 
social vulnerabilities. Younger patients (p = 0.021), non-white patients (p < 
0.001), patients identifying as non-heterosexual (p = 0.014), without a partner 
(p < 0.001) or private insurance (p = 0.040), and those with lower household 
income (p < 0.001) were more likely to report elevated psychosocial 
vulnerability. Patients with elevated psychosocial vulnerability were more 
likely to reside in deprived neighborhoods (ADI: 34.0 vs. 29.0, p = 0.035; SVI: 
0.35 vs. 0.27, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Patients undergoing major cancer surgery 
experience substantial psychosocial vulnerabilities, particularly those from 
socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Future work should identify the 
psychosocial factors most predictive of poor surgical outcomes to guide targeted 
preoperative interventions.

Differences.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths, with notable sex-specific differences in its incidence, 
diagnosis, and outcomes. Our previous work identified casein kinase 2 alpha 
(CK2α) as being capable of impairing DNA mismatch repair (MMR) via 
phosphorylation of MLH1, thereby increasing the tumor mutational burden. This 
study aimed to investigate sex-specific differences in CK2α protein expression 
in CRC.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed on 161 CRC tumors and 
adjacent normal tissues to quantify the CK2α protein levels. A multi-cohort 
meta-analysis of proteomic and clinical data was conducted to validate our 
findings and assess the correlations with age, sex, and relevant signaling 
pathways.
RESULTS: Female CRC patients exhibited significantly higher CK2α expression than 
male patients, which was confirmed in two independent cohorts. Additionally, 
CK2α expression was positively correlated with age in female but not male 
patients. Cross-cohort correlation analyses linked CK2α levels with key proteins 
involved in estrogen receptor signaling and aging, including DEAD-box helicase 5 
(DDX5), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA), prohibitin-2 (PHB2), H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 2 (NHP2), 
and dual-specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MAP2K3).
CONCLUSIONS: CK2α is significantly overexpressed in the tumor tissue of female 
CRC patients and shows a strong age-related correlation. These findings suggest 
a sex- and age-specific regulatory mechanism potentially influenced by estrogen 
signaling or menopause. Such dimorphisms underscore the need for sex-specific 
strategies in CRC biomarker development and therapy.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health burden and a leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality, with metastasis representing the primary cause of 
death. Angiogenesis plays a critical role in this process, and macrophages 
within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are its key regulators. Among these, 
Tie2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) constitute a distinct pro-angiogenic subset 
that localizes to perivascular regions and responds to angiopoietin2 (Ang2) 
signaling. Moreover, TEMs contribute to vessel destabilization and the formation 
of permissive niches for cancer cell intravasation, linking them to both 
angiogenic and non-angiogenic modes of malignant tumor progression. The 
significance of TEMs in CRC remains controversial. This controversy, as we 
noticed, stems from a confluence of methodological challenges, lack of 
standardized markers, small-scale studies, inconsistent findings across studies, 
and the inherent complexity of both CRC biology and macrophage biology. Evidence 
from preclinical models and patient samples highlights the correlation between 
Ang2/Tie2 activity, TEM infiltration, and poor prognosis in CRC. This review 
summarizes current knowledge on the role of TEMs and the Ang/Tie2 axis in CRC 
angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies. Advancing 
our understanding of TEMs may enable novel macrophage-focused strategies to 
inhibit CRC progression and improve patient outcomes.

Background: Irradiation (IR) targets cancer cells, but also the tumor 
microenvironment, including the tumor's blood vessels. In addition to tumor 
endothelial cell (TEC) apoptosis, IR can lead to TEC activation, potentially 
increasing immune cell infiltration. However, the changes underlying the 
IR-induced activation of endothelial cells (ECs) are poorly understood. This 
study investigated dose- and time-dependent molecular and functional responses 
of murine and human EC lines to IR in vitro and TECs in vivo in murine tumor 
models of colorectal carcinoma. Methods: HUVEC, EA.hy926, and Hulec5a, as well 
as murine bEND.3, 2H11, and SVEC4-10 EC lines, were irradiated with single doses 
of 2-10 Gy. EC proliferation and survival after IR were assessed by staining all 
nuclei (Hoechst 33342) and dead cells (propidium iodide) every 24 h for 5 days 
using the Cytation 1 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader. RNA sequencing analysis of 
HUVECs irradiated with 2 Gy and 5 Gy at 24 h and 72 h after IR was conducted, 
focusing on processes related to EC activation. To validate the RNA sequencing 
results, immunofluorescence staining for proteins related to EC activation, 
including Stimulator of Interferon Response cGAMP Interactor 1 (STING), Nuclear 
factor kappa B (NF-κβ), and Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), was 
performed. To validate the in vitro results, the response of TEC in vivo was 
analyzed using publicly available RNA sequencing data of TECs isolated from MC38 
colon carcinoma irradiated with a single dose of 15 Gy. Finally, murine CT26 
colon carcinoma tumors were immunofluorescently stained for STING and NF-κβ 24 
and 48 h after IR with a clinically relevant fractionated regimen of 5 × 5 Gy. 
Results: Doses of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 Gy led to a dose-dependent decrease in 
proliferation and increased death of ECs. RNA sequencing analysis showed that 
the effects on the transcriptome of HUVECs were most pronounced 72 h after IR 
with 5 Gy, with 1014 genes (661 down-regulated and 353 up-regulated) being 
significantly differentially expressed. Irradiation with 5 Gy resulted in HUVEC 
activation, with up-regulation of the immune system and extracellular matrix 
genes, such as STING1 (log2FC = 0.81) and SELE (log2FC = 1.09), respectively; 
and down-regulation of cell cycle markers. Furthermore, IR led to the 
up-regulation of immune response- and extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated 
signaling pathways, including NF-κβ signaling and ECM-receptor interaction, 
which was also observed in the transcriptome of irradiated murine TECs in vivo. 
This was confirmed at the protein level with higher expressions of the EC 
activation-associated proteins STING, NF-κβ, and VCAM-1 in irradiated HUVECs and 
irradiated TECs in vivo. Conclusions: IR induces changes in ECs and TECs, 
supporting their activation in dose- and time-dependent manners, potentially 
contributing to the anti-tumor immune response, which may potentially increase 
the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor and thus, improve the overall 
efficacy of RT, especially in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as 
diagnosis before age 50, is rising rapidly and disproportionately affects 
Hispanic/Latino (H/L) populations. While FOLFOX is a standard first-line 
chemotherapy, its impact on tumor genomics in EOCRC remains poorly understood. 
Given the central role of WNT signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC), we aimed to 
characterize WNT pathway alterations in EOCRC across diverse populations and 
assess their associations with FOLFOX treatment and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Somatic mutation data from 2515 CRC patients (266 H/L, 2249 
Non-Hispanic White [NHW]) were analyzed. Patients were stratified by age (EOCRC 
vs. late-onset colorectal cancer), ancestry (H/L vs. NHW), and FOLFOX treatment 
status. Mutation frequencies in WNT pathway genes were compared, and 
Kaplan-Meier analysis evaluated overall survival.
RESULTS: WNT pathway alterations were pervasive across groups, with APC 
mutations dominating. Notably, non-canonical WNT mutations (e.g., CTNNB1, RNF43) 
were significantly less frequent in FOLFOX-treated H/L EOCRC patients compared 
to untreated individuals, suggesting potential chemotherapy-driven selection. In 
NHW patients, FOLFOX treatment was associated with reduced mutation frequencies 
across multiple WNT regulators, which correlated with improved overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that WNT pathway dysregulation in EOCRC is 
shaped by ancestry, treatment status, and age. FOLFOX appears to reduce specific 
WNT alterations in H/L patients and broader WNT disruptions in NHW patients, 
with survival benefits observed primarily in the latter. These results 
underscore ancestry-specific molecular responses to chemotherapy and the need 
for precision oncology strategies tailored to high-risk populations.

BACKGROUND: Liver resection remains the gold standard treatment for colorectal 
cancer (CRC) liver metastases, while stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) 
offers an alternative for patients with unresectable metastases. However, the 
precise indications for SBRT, optimal radiation doses, and treatment regimens 
have yet to be definitively established.
METHODS: A total of 91 patients with 152 lesions underwent SBRT, receiving a 
total dose ranging from 40 to 60 Gy delivered in 4-5 fractions per lesion, with 
a median dose of 50 Gy.
RESULTS: The three-year local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) rates were 
62.6% and 45.1%, respectively. No cases of Grade ≥ 3 toxicity were observed. 
Factors negatively affecting LC included metastasis diameter ≥ 2.7 cm and number 
of metastases ≥ 3, with hazard ratios (HR) of 2.73 and 2.24, respectively. A 
biologically effective dose (BED) of ≥137.7 Gy was associated with a significant 
improvement in local control (LC) (HR 0.25), a finding that was also confirmed 
by the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis. Significant 
predictors for poorer OS included RAS gene mutations, metastasis diameter ≥ 2.6 
cm, and synchronous metastases, with HRs of 2.27, 2.03, and 2.11, respectively. 
Landmark analysis demonstrated that local recurrence within 12 months after SBRT 
significantly reduced OS (HR 2.68).
CONCLUSIONS: SBRT is a safe and effective method for achieving local control of 
CRC liver oligometastases. Further research is warranted to optimize treatment 
protocols and refine patient selection criteria.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden. While 
early-stage CRC has a high survival rate, most patients are diagnosed with 
advanced disease, necessitating more effective and less toxic therapeutic 
targets. This review examines recent advancements, challenges, and future 
directions in targeted therapies for CRC, focusing on HER inhibitors. We assess 
the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) and explore strategies to overcome resistance mechanisms. Targeted 
therapies like cetuximab and panitumumab have improved outcomes for CRC patients 
with wild-type KRAS. However, resistance mechanisms and intra- and inter-tumour 
heterogeneity limit their effectiveness. Recent advancements include the 
development of dual TKIs, antibody/drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific 
antibodies, and CAR-T cells against HER family members and other targets that 
are showing promise in preclinical and clinical trials. Targeted therapies have 
transformed CRC treatment, but more research is needed to overcome some of the 
current challenges, such as late diagnosis and the heterogenous nature of CRC, 
as well as the discovery of more reliable biomarkers for response to the therapy 
and patient selection. Future research should focus on identifying novel 
biomarkers of diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive value, developing 
next-generation inhibitors, drug repurposing, and combining small-molecule 
targeted therapies with immunotherapy. Such advances could ultimately help 
increase both the treatment options and outcomes for patients with CRC.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors remain a cornerstone in the 
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with RAS and BRAF wild-type cancer. 
Yet, primary and acquired resistance limit their benefit for many patients. A 
growing body of evidence reveals that resistance is not random but rather driven 
by a complex network of molecular alterations that sustain tumor growth 
independent of EGFR signaling. These include amplification of ERBB2 (HER2) and 
MET, activation of the PI3K and AKT pathways, EGFR extracellular domain 
mutations, and rare kinase fusions. The concept of negative hyperselection has 
emerged as a powerful strategy to refine patient selection by excluding tumors 
with these resistance drivers. Multiple clinical trials have consistently shown 
that patients who are hyperselected based on comprehensive molecular profiling 
achieve significantly higher response rates and improved survival compared to 
those selected by RAS and BRAF status alone. Liquid biopsy through circulating 
tumor DNA has further transformed this landscape, offering a noninvasive tool to 
capture tumor heterogeneity, monitor clonal evolution in real time, and guide 
rechallenge strategies after resistance emerges. Together, negative 
hyperselection, ctDNA-guided monitoring, and emerging therapeutics define a 
precision-oncology framework for identifying, tracking, and overcoming 
resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC, moving the field toward more effective 
and individualized care. Looking ahead, the development of innovative 
therapeutics such as bispecific antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, and 
RNA-based therapies promises to further expand in this challenging clinical 
scenario. These advances move precision oncology in colorectal cancer from 
concept to clinical reality, reshaping the standard of care through molecular 
insights.

KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer. Its activating mutations 
are associated with aggressive tumor behavior and resistance to certain 
therapies, including anti-EGFR treatments in colorectal cancer. In particular, 
the KRAS G12C mutation, which accounts for approximately 3-4% of colorectal 
cancers (CRCs) and 12-14% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), involves a 
cysteine substitution at codon 12. This has provided the opportunity to develop 
selective covalent inhibitors that trap the mutant protein in its inactive 
state. The first targeted therapies for KRAS G12C-mutant cancers comprise 
sotorasib and adagrasib, both of which have been authorized for use in patients 
with previously treated NSCLC and CRC. Nevertheless, despite the evidence of 
clinical activity for this class of agents, primary and acquired resistance, 
dose optimization, and toxicity management remain significant open challenges. 
In this review, we summarize recent advances in KRASG12C tumor biology and 
pharmacological targeting. We also provide additional insights to guide future 
efforts to overcome the limitations of the current approaches and implement the 
treatment of KRASG12C-mutant cancers.

Background: Young-onset colorectal cancer (YO-CRC) has emerged as a distinct 
clinical entity, often presenting at advanced stages. Despite the increasing 
incidence, the molecular and clinical underpinnings of YO-CRC remain 
underexplored. This study aims to characterize the clinical and molecular 
features of YO-CRC and to evaluate their impact on OS. Methods: We reviewed 110 
patients diagnosed with YO-CRC at our institution who underwent next-generation 
sequencing. Demographic, clinical, and molecular data, including age, gender, 
race, tumor location, cancer stage, and mutation status (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, POLE, 
ERBB-2/HER2, microsatellite status), were collected by reviewing electronic 
medical records. For OS analysis, we focused on patients diagnosed with de novo 
stage IV. Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
were utilized to assess the association of these factors with OS, with 
statistical significance determined by a p-value threshold of <0.05. Results: 
Among 110 patients, n = 44 (40%) presented with local disease (stage 1-3), while 
n = 66 (60%) presented with de novo metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. 
The median age at diagnosis was 44.5 years. The cohort consisted of 64% males 
and 36% females, with 84% of patients identified as White. Most tumors were 
left-sided (77%), including the distal colon/sigmoid (44%) and rectum (33%). 
KRAS and BRAF mutations were present in 36% and 5.5%, respectively. ERBB-2/HER2 
amplification and microsatellite instability were observed in 4.5% and 6.4%, 
respectively. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was <10 in 57% of patients, with 14% 
having TMB > 20. CNV analysis revealed that 14% of patients had copy gains, 12% 
had concurrent gains/losses, and 31% had copy losses. Among 66 patients with de 
novo metastatic disease, 44% had died by the time of analysis, with a median 
overall survival (OS) of 43.6 months (95% CI, 28.7-not reached). KRAS mutations 
were found to be significantly associated with worse survival outcomes. Cox 
regression analysis reveals the prognostic significance of KRAS status, with a 
hazard ratio (HR) of 3.52 (95% CI: 1.59-7.76, p = 0.002), indicating a 
significantly higher risk of death for KRAS-mutant YO-CRC patients. Conclusions: 
Patients with YO-CRC are more likely to present with de novo metastatic disease 
and left-sided tumors with distinct molecular characteristics. KRAS mutations 
are a key prognostic factor in YO-CRC, highlighting the need for therapeutic 
interventions to improve outcomes in this high-risk group.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Electrochemotherapy (ECT) has been shown to be effective 
in treating colorectal liver metastases when combined with bleomycin (BLM). 
Based on this promising finding, we compared in this study the efficacy of BLM 
with oxaliplatin (OXP) and bevacizumab (BVZ) in ECT.
METHODS: WAG/Rij rats were randomized into three groups and underwent ECT with 
intravenous injection of BLM, OXP, or OXP with BVZ for eight days following 
hepatic tumor cell implantation. Ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging served to 
assess oxygen saturation (SO2) and hemoglobin concentration (HbT) of the 
developing tumors. Tissue samples were analyzed by histology and 
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: BLM treatment significantly reduced SO2 (33.7%) and HbT (12.7%) levels 
compared to pretreatment values. In contrast, the OXP-treated groups exhibited 
only modest reductions in both parameters. BLM also induced a markedly higher 
necrosis rate (82.6%) compared to OXP and OXP/BVZ (11.0% and 26.3%). Conversely, 
OXP-treated tumors exhibited higher apoptosis rates. Furthermore, BLM treatment 
led to a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and a reduction in inflammatory 
response compared to the other treatments. Notably, BLM caused a 26.2% reduction 
in CD31-positive microvessels, which was significantly higher than that observed 
in the OXP group. Conclusions: BLM showed a more effective anti-tumor activity 
than OXP, suggesting its preferred use as chemotherapeutic agent in ECT.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related mortality worldwide, emphasizing the urgent need for early, 
non-invasive, and accessible diagnostic tools. This study aimed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based electronic nose 
(E-nose) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for 
CRC detection through sweat volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
METHODS: A total of 136 sweat samples were collected from 68 volunteer 
participants. Samples were processed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) 
and analyzed by GC-MS, while a custom-designed E-nose system comprising 14 gas 
sensors captured real-time VOC profiles. Data were analyzed using multivariate 
statistical techniques, including PCA and PLS-DA, and classified with machine 
learning algorithms (LDA, LR, SVM, k-NN).
RESULTS: GC-MS analysis revealed statistically significant differences between 
CRC patients and healthy controls (COs). Cross-validation showed that the 
highest classification accuracy for GC-MS data was 81% with the k-NN classifier, 
whereas E-nose data achieved up to 97% accuracy using the LDA classifier.
CONCLUSIONS: Sweat volatilome analysis, supported by advanced data processing 
and complementary use of E-nose technology and GC-MS, demonstrates strong 
potential as a reliable, non-invasive approach for early CRC detection.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: At least 25% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop 
liver metastases (CRLM), and chemotherapeutic regimens based on the 
fluoropyrimidine (FP) drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) provide a survival advantage, 
but long-term survival is uncommon. The primary molecular target of FP drugs is 
thymidylate synthase (TS).
METHODS: A TS/Top1 dual-targeting cytotoxic mechanism for CF10/LV was confirmed 
by TS ternary complex detection by Western blot and by immunofluorescence 
detection of Top1 cleavage complexes. CF10/LV activated the ATR/Chk1 pathway 
consistent with enhanced replication stress and induced apoptosis. In vivo 
studies showed CF10 and CF10/LV eradicated liver metastasis in a CRLM model 
without scarring or weight loss, displaying therapeutic advantages relative to 
legacy FPs.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that a nanoscale FP polymer, CF10, displayed greater 
potency than expected based on FP content in part through more direct conversion 
to the TS-inhibitory metabolite, FdUMP. In this study, we tested CF10 for 
potency advantages relative to 5-FU and trifluorothymidine (TFT, the FP 
component of TAS-102) and confirmed a general potency advantage for CF10 in CRC 
cell lines in the Broad Institute PRISM screen. We demonstrated that this 
potency advantage is retained in CRC cells cultured with human-like folate 
levels and is enhanced by LV co-treatment to a similar extent as that by 5-FU. 
Our results confirm CF10 development proceeding as a CF10/LV combination. 
Mechanistically, CF10 cytotoxicity closely correlates with poisons of DNA 
topoisomerase 1 (Top1) in the PRISM screen relative to 5-FU and TFT.
CONCLUSIONS: Our pre-clinical data support an early-phase clinical trial for 
CF10 for treating liver-metastatic CRC.

Background: Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) carries the bft toxin 
gene, which influences the host immune response and inflammatory pathways and 
promotes colorectal cancer (CRC). This study investigated the potential role of 
ETBF in CRC liver metastasis. Methods: We reviewed the records of 226 
consecutive patients who underwent curative-intent (R0) resection of CRC liver 
metastases. ETBF DNA in fresh-frozen metastasis specimens was quantified using 
droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Patients were grouped into very-low (≤80%; N = 
178), low (80-90%; N = 24), and high (>90%; N = 24) ETBF-DNA groups. Three 
tissue cores per specimen were stained for CD8, CD4, CD20, FOXP3, CD68, and 
CD163, and immune-cell densities were measured digitally (cells/mm2). Results: 
ETBF DNA was detected in 219 of 226 lesions (96.9%). The densities of cytotoxic 
CD8+ T-cells, effector CD4+ T-cells, CD20+ B-cells, and CD163+ macrophages did 
not differ significantly by ETBF-DNA group (Ptrend all > 0.12). FOXP3+ 
regulatory T-cells (Tregs) decreased (Ptrend = 0.010), and CD68+ macrophages 
increased (Ptrend = 0.020) as ETBF-DNA levels increased. ETBF-DNA levels in CRC 
liver metastases were not associated with disease-free survival or overall 
survival or serum C-reactive protein levels. Conclusions: ETBF was present in 
almost all CRC liver metastases. Higher ETBF levels were associated with a 
tumor-immune microenvironment enriched in CD68+ macrophages and deficient in 
FOXP3+ Tregs, suggesting that ETBF facilitates immune evasion without loss of 
effector lymphocytes. Although ETBF-DNA levels did not predict survival in this 
single-center cohort, the potential role of ETBF in immune remodeling and as a 
candidate biomarker and therapeutic target in metastatic CRC warrants further 
study.

Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, particularly colorectal and gastric cancers, 
majorly contribute to global cancer mortality due to frequent late-stage 
diagnosis and poor therapeutic response in advanced disease. Earlier detection 
of GI cancers is needed for a better prognosis. This review examines both 
traditional and emerging biomarkers that contribute significantly to early 
detection, prognostication, and prediction of therapeutic resistance or 
sensitivity. Specifically, we highlight the diagnostic utility of non-invasive 
liquid biopsy biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNAs 
(miRNAs), and exosomes. Moreover, we discuss the prognostic and predictive value 
of conventional genetic alterations, including KRAS, BRAF, and HER2. Although 
new findings have shown the advantages of liquid biopsy over colonoscopy, there 
are still limitations to the technique, such as cost-effectiveness, 
technological gaps in low-resource settings, and uncertain detection rates. 
Further studies are required to test the validity and accessibility of liquid 
biopsy and its biomarkers in order to advance personalized diagnosis and 
treatments for GI cancers. Such a study will be helpful for clinicians to better 
manage patients with GI cancers.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequent malignancy and 
the second cause of cancer-related death worldwide. CRC is characterized by 
morphologic and biological heterogeneity, and molecular profiling is required to 
select appropriate treatment in the metastatic setting. Mutations in KRAS are 
detected in approximately 40% of CRCs, with prognostic and predictive value, and 
with the most frequent being p.G12D. Nonetheless, there are few data on the 
morphologic features in KRAS-mutated CRCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinicopathological features 
and molecular profiles of CRCs in a multicenter cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 2816 patients from 12 centers were included. KRAS mutation 
was found in 47.4% of cases; Gly12Asp was detected in 23.9%, with different 
mutation frequencies between centers. Clinicohistological features associated 
with Gly12Asp mutation included younger patient age (≤70 years of age), higher 
prevalence in males (58.6%), NOS histotype (87.1%), low pathologic grade 
(73.9%), high grade budding-Bd3 (43.8%), and tumoral lympho-vascular invasion 
(68.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Recent data have pinpointed the prognostic and predictive value of 
Gly12Asp mutation, and our results contribute to understanding its biology, with 
particular focus on peculiar clinicopathological features. Moreover, we found 
significant differences in pathology reports and assays for molecular profiling 
in different centers, which can affect a standardized therapeutic approach in 
CRC.

BACKGROUND: Genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, leads to copy number 
variations disrupting gene dosage balance and contributing to tumor progression. 
One of the most affected oncogenes is MYC, whose overexpression is tightly 
regulated to avoid cytotoxicity. In aneuploid cancer cells, gene dosage 
compensation mechanisms involving microRNAs (miRNAs) from the miR-17/92 cluster 
contribute in regulating MYC expression. Targeting this miRNA-mediated 
compensation system represents a promising therapeutic strategy leading to an 
uncontrolled and lethal MYC overexpression.
RESULTS: Synthetic miRNA sponges targeting miR-17, miR-19a, and miR-20a, key 
regulators of MYC dosage compensation, were designed and validated. Breast 
cancer cells (MCF7) with stable exogenous MYC overexpression were used to assess 
the impact of sponge constructs on MYC regulation. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed 
a significant reduction in miRNA expression and a corresponding increase in 
endogenous MYC levels upon sponge treatment. Functional assays in multiple 
colorectal cancer cell lines with varying MYC copy numbers demonstrated a 
time-dependent increase in cell death following sponge transfection. Cytotoxic 
effects increased with MYC copy number, confirming a correlation between gene 
dosage sensitivity and therapeutic response.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that miRNA sponges targeting the miR-17/92 
cluster can effectively disrupt MYC dosage compensation, leading to selective 
cytotoxicity in MYC-amplified cancer cells.

Skin cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with rising incidence 
and associated mortality in late-stage and drug-resistant cases. This 
underscores a continuing need for more effective novel therapeutic options that 
can be utilized for efficient management of skin cancers. A promising approach 
involves exploiting novel targets, which are dysregulated in skin cancer, either 
alone or in combination with existing therapeutics. Among these, polo-like 
kinases (PLKs), a family of serine/threonine kinases, has emerged as promising 
candidates due to their essential role in cell cycle and maintaining genomic 
stability, key hallmarks of cancer. Within this family, polo-like kinase 4 
(PLK4) stands out as a structurally distinct member and the master regulator of 
centriole duplication, ensuring this process occurs only once per cell division. 
Dysregulation of PLK4 can disrupt genomic integrity, contributing to 
tumorigenesis, thus making it a promising target for cancer management. Notably, 
PLK4 is frequently overexpressed in several cancers, including skin cancer, and 
its precise role in skin cancer is an area of current investigation. Further, 
several small-molecule PLK4 inhibitors such as centrinone, YLZ-F5, CFI-400945, 
and RP-1664 have demonstrated efficacy in targeting PLK4. Among these, 
CFI-400945 has advanced to clinical trials, where it has shown modest 
anti-cancer activity. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the 
known functions of PLK4 in skin cancer. Additionally, we discuss potential 
mechanistic insights into PLK4's involvement in skin cancer progression by 
extrapolating evidence from studies in other cancer types including colorectal 
cancer, thyroid cancer, lymphomas, leukemia, etc., while identifying gaps for 
future research.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In countries with an intermediate incidence of gastric 
cancer (GC), it has been suggested that offering an upper gastrointestinal 
endoscopy (UGIE) to individuals referred for a screening colonoscopy following a 
positive result in the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) may be cost-effective. 
This study was designed to evaluate the impact of a FIT-based screening program 
on GC incidence, early diagnosis, and mortality.
METHODS: Population-based retrospective cohort study in northern Portugal. Data 
on GC cases were retrieved from the Portuguese National Cancer Registry (RON). 
GC stage at diagnosis (with early stages defined as T1) and net survival 
estimates were compared between 2014 and 2016 and the first 3 years of the 
FIT-based screening program (2018-2020), during which 165,967 tests were 
performed.
RESULTS: The odds of GC detection were significantly higher among FIT-positive 
individuals compared to those with a negative result (OR = 2.87; 95% CI: 
1.76-4.49). Of the 10,372 individuals who completed FIT screening and underwent 
colonoscopy, 51% (n = 5281) also underwent UGIE. The proportion of early-stage 
diagnoses increased by 14% (95% CI: 12-15), and 3-year net survival improved 
from 42% (95% CI: 40-43) to 48% (95% CI: 47-50).
DISCUSSION: Despite the absence of a formal GC screening program, more than half 
of FIT-screened individuals who underwent colonoscopy also underwent UGIE. The 
period following the implementation of FIT-based screening was associated with 
increased early-stage detection and improved survival. These findings support 
the potential value of offering UGIE combined with colonoscopy for FIT-positive 
individuals, at least in regions with intermediate GC incidence.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) oncologic emergency presentations are 
associated with poor prognosis and place a significant burden on health care 
resources. While tumor and biological patient factors have been reported as risk 
factors, social determinants have not been thoroughly examined. This study aimed 
to examine the frequency of CRC oncologic emergencies and its association with 
neighborhood deprivation.
METHODS: We used the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database, a 
nationwide administrative dataset in Japan, for patients diagnosed with CRC 
receiving specific treatment for the 2014-2019 fiscal years. Neighborhood 
deprivation was assessed by linking patient residential postcodes and area 
deprivation index (ADI). We used a multilevel logistic regression model to 
compare the likelihood of oncologic emergencies across different degrees of ADI 
and examined effect modification by sex through age-stratified analysis to 
consider differences in social structures.
RESULTS: Of 488,841 eligible CRC patients, 56,311 (11.5%) had experienced an 
oncologic emergency. We identified a disparity: the higher the degree of ADI, 
the greater the likelihood of oncologic emergencies (odds ratio for most vs. 
least deprived area 1.19; 95% confidence interval 1.15-1.23). This disparity was 
more pronounced in males than in females, but was observed only among 
middle-aged males, among whom regular employment was most common.
CONCLUSION: The likelihood of oncologic emergencies was higher in the 
neighborhoods with higher deprivation levels. The magnitude of this disparity 
differed by sex and was particularly pronounced among those of working age, 
underscoring the need to further explore how socioeconomic factors-such as 
access to workplace cancer screening-shape these differences.

BACKGROUND: Hepatic arterial infusion pump (HAIP) chemotherapy delivers 
continuous locoregional chemotherapy directly to the liver, maximizing 
intrahepatic tumor exposure while minimizing systemic toxicity. Originally 
developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, HAIP chemotherapy with 
floxuridine is increasingly used for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). This paper presents a review of phase II 
and III trials, retrospective studies, and ongoing prospective trials was 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy of HAIP floxuridine combined with systemic 
regimens in patients with unresectable and resectable liver-confined CRLM and 
iCCA.
RESULTS: In unresectable CRLM, HAIP yields conversion rates between 20 to 55% 
resulting in 5-year overall survival (OS) up to 50%. In the setting of adjuvant 
HAIP after resection of CRLM, a first large randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
showed a 2-year OS of 86% compared with 72% in patients with adjuvant systemic 
therapy alone. In a second RCT, the median OS was 47 months after HAIP with 
systemic chemotherapy versus 34 months without adjuvant chemotherapy. For 
unresectable iCCA, studies have found a response rate of 21% and a 3-year OS of 
3% following systemic therapy alone (ABC trials), while outcomes for patients 
receiving HAIP chemotherapy combined with systemic therapy have included 
response rates up to 58% and 3-year OS up to 43%.
CONCLUSION: Hepatic arterial infusion pump floxuridine is an effective 
locoregional treatment that improves survival in patients with liver-confined 
CRLM and iCCA. Confirmation from ongoing RCTs is awaited to define its role 
alongside evolving systemic therapies.

AIMS: To elucidate the influencing factors of family resilience among 
postoperative colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and how family resilience is 
affected by family function and mutuality.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 216 postoperative CRC patients were 
recruited from two Hospitals in Henan Province, China, between February and July 
2023. First, we examined the impact of sociodemographic and disease-related 
factors on family resilience using t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and post hoc 
comparisons. Given the importance of family coping capacity in postoperative 
outcomes, we further assessed family resilience, function, and mutuality using 
the Family Resilience Questionnaire, the Family APGAR Scale (Adaptation, 
Partnership, Growth, Affection, Resolve), and the Mutuality Scale. Finally, we 
examined the interactions among the three variables through Pearson correlation 
and the SPSS PROCESS macro.
RESULTS: Six factors were identified as being associated with family resilience 
among families of postoperative CRC patients, i.e., postoperative duration, 
education level, marital status, working status, family income, and stoma 
status. Family resilience was positively correlated with mutuality 
(r = 0.170 ~ 0.473, p < 0.05) and family function (r = 0.135 ~ 0.451, p < 0.05). 
Moreover, healthy family mutuality enhanced family resilience, with its 
effectiveness moderated by family function.
CONCLUSIONS: Beyond sociodemographic and disease-related factors, this study 
explored family resilience in CRC patient families from a broader perspective by 
examining its interaction with family function and mutuality. Our results 
suggest that healthcare professionals should assess family resilience not only 
at the individual level but also from the perspective of the whole family, to 
develop effective interventions that strengthen families' coping and adaptive 
capacities during postoperative cancer care.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in the progression of colorectal cancer 
(CRC). The high heterogeneity of CSCs has hindered the clinical application of 
CSC-targeting therapies. Tetracyclines are drugs with therapeutic potentials 
beyond their antibiotic activity. We previously demonstrated the efficacy of 
tigecycline, a third-generation tetracycline, against a model of 
colitis-associated colorectal cancer, primarily focusing on its immunomodulatory 
role with a preliminary assessment of its impact on stemness. In this study we 
characterize the effects of tigecycline on colon CSCs in vitro and in a CRC 
xenograft model, with special attention on the signaling pathways involved and 
the modulation of the gut microbiota. We generated secondary colonospheres from 
two colon tumor cell lines HCT116 and CMT93, and evaluated the effect of 
tigecycline on CSCs properties. We showed that tigecycline (25, 50 μM) 
effectively reduced colon CD133+CD44+LGR5+ALDH+ subpopulations and their 
viability, self-renewal and migratory capacity. Moreover, tigecycline treatment 
hindered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process through targeting SNAI1 
and β-catenin, resulting in an upregulation of epithelial markers (E-cadherin) 
and a downregulation of pluripotency and mesenchymal ones (Vimentin, N-cadherin, 
SOX2, NANOG, MIR155, MIR146). This effect was confirmed in two independent 
CRC-xenograft murine models in which tigecycline administration led to a 
reduction in tumor volume. Finally, CRC samples were taken from HCT116 xenograft 
model mice for analysis of CSCs-related signaling pathways and stools were 
collected for gut microbiome metagenomic analysis. We found that the antibiotic 
modulated gut dysbiosis by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacterial 
species such as Parabacteroides sp., which were involved in metabolic pathways 
that hindered SNAI1-Wnt-β-catenin signaling. These results reinforce the new

Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, necessitating the discovery 
of novel therapeutic agents with improved efficacy and selectivity. This study 
investigated the anticancer potential of Aspergillus niger strain AW17 isolated 
from honeybees, a previously unexplored ecological niche for anticancer drug 
discovery. The fungal isolate was characterized through morphological, 
microscopic, and molecular methods, confirming its identity as Aspergillus 
niger. Chemical profiling using GC-MS and UPLC-MS/MS revealed a complex 
composition including high oleic acid content (28.88%) and unique compounds like 
pachymic acid (18.93%), rarely associated with A. niger. The extract's 
anticancer activity was evaluated against colorectal (Caco-2), liver (HepG2), 
breast (MCF-7), and lung (A549) cancer cell lines using MTT assay, confocal 
microscopy with AO/PI staining, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis detection. 
Results demonstrated remarkable selective cytotoxicity of the Aspergillus niger 
extract against cancer cell lines, following the sensitivity hierarchy HepG2 
(IC50 = 5.22 µg/ml) > Caco-2 (26.78 µg/ml) > A549 (34.18 µg/ml) > MCF-7 
(55.91 µg/ml), while sparing normal cell lines significantly, with IC50 values 
of 1454.7 µg/ml for WI-38 and 668.3 µg/ml for HFB-4, indicating high cancer cell 
selectivity. Confocal microscopy confirmed membrane integrity loss as a primary 
cytotoxic mechanism. Cell cycle analysis revealed cell-type specific arrest 
patterns, with Caco-2 and HepG2 exhibiting G1 arrest, while MCF-7 and A549 
showed S phase accumulation. Flow cytometry indicated distinct death mechanisms, 
with Caco-2 undergoing early apoptosis and substantial necrosis, HepG2 showing 
predominant late apoptosis, and A549 displaying primary necrotic death. These 
findings highlight the potential of honeybee-associated fungi as sources of 
novel anticancer compounds with remarkable selectivity, providing new avenues 
for targeted cancer therapy development and demonstrating the value of exploring 
specialized ecological niches in natural product discovery.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence remains a major challenge in postsurgery. 
Chronic inflammation driven by cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and prostaglandin pathways 
promotes tumor recurrence, encouraging interest in nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) and 
COX-2 inhibitors. While observational studies suggest a benefit in reducing 
recurrence, randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence is controversial. This 
meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of adjuvant NSAIDs in 
nonmetastatic resected CRC. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and 
Cochrane Central for RCTs comparing anti-inflammatory agents to placebo in 
postoperative CRC patients. Primary outcomes included overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS); secondary outcomes were time to recurrence (TTR), 
recurrence rate, and adverse events. Subgroup analyses focused on aspirin use 
and the presence of PI3K pathway mutations were performed. Five RCTs (7246 
patients) were included. Anti-inflammatory therapy improved DFS (HR = 0.85; 95% 
CI: 0.76-0.96; P = .008) and TTR (HR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44-0.84; P = .003) but 
not OS (HR = 0.90; P = .07) or recurrence rates (RR = 0.90; P = .06). Aspirin 
demonstrated superior DFS benefit (HR = 0.70; P = .03) and patients with PI3K 
mutations had markedly reduced recurrence risk (HR = 0.56; P < .0001). Serious 
cardiac events, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infections showed no significant 
differences. Adjuvant anti-inflammatory therapy improves DFS and delays 
recurrence in postoperative CRC, with pronounced benefit in PIK3CA mutant 
tumors. These findings support biomarker-driven strategies and highlight the 
need for ongoing trials to validate long-term efficacy and safety.

BACKGROUND: The 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) component of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, 
and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy is a known cause of coronary vasospasm. 
Diagnosis can be difficult, often leading to interruption of chemotherapy.
CASE SUMMARY: A 53-year-old man with a history of colorectal cancer developed 
new-onset angina after initiation of FOLFOX chemotherapy. He underwent a left 
heart catheterization, coronary functional testing (CFT), and acetylcholine 
(ACh) provocation. ACh provocation elicited similar angina, consistent with 
microvascular vasospasm. This prompted initiation of calcium-channel blockers 
and adjustments to chemotherapy administration, preventing further angina.
DISCUSSION: CFT with ACh provocation should be considered in patients undergoing 
chemotherapy with 5-FU. As 5-FU coronary vasospasm is often transient, ACh 
provocation can identify patients who would benefit from calcium-channel 
blockers and changing 5-FU administration from continuous to bolus dosing.
TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: This case highlights the utility of CFT in identifying and 
guiding treatment in suspected cases of 5-FU-associated coronary vasospasm.

Chronic intestinal inflammation is a significant risk factor for colorectal 
cancer (CRC), and gamma-delta (γδ) T cells have emerged as pivotal regulators in 
this transition. γδ T cells are now understood to play a dual role in 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), contributing to both anti-inflammatory and 
pro-inflammatory responses. They facilitate mucosal healing and maintain 
epithelial barrier integrity by secreting factors such as interleukin-22 
(IL-22). Conversely, they can intensify chronic intestinal inflammation by 
releasing cytokines like IL-17. Interestingly, the dual functionality of γδ T 
cells has been documented in CRC. Certain subsets of γδ T cells contribute to 
anti-tumor immunity by exerting cytotoxic effects and producing interferon-γ 
(IFN-γ). In contrast, other subsets promote tumor progression by inducing 
immunosuppression and angiogenesis, primarily through the secretion of IL-17 and 
IL-22. Furthermore, the IL-17/IL-22-signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway has been identified as a critical 
mediator linking chronic intestinal inflammation to malignancy. This axis 
initially facilitates tissue repair; however, its prolonged activation can lead 
to oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells. Therefore, a comprehensive 
understanding of the dual roles of γδ T cells not only provides critical 
insights into the immunopathological mechanisms of CRC but also offers a 
theoretical basis for developing targeted immunotherapies. We summarized the 
preclinical and clinical progress of γδ T cells combined immunotherapy 
strategies. Preliminary clinical trials leveraging this knowledge have shown 
promising results in reducing inflammation and improving therapeutic outcomes, 
underscoring the translational potential of γδ T cell modulation in CRC 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is preventable and patients with colorectal 
adenomas are at high risk for colorectal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a complex prebiotic 
formulation on the gut microbiota and inflammation levels in colorectal adenoma 
patients.
METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial assigned patients 
with adenomatous polyps to either the prebiotic intervention group (N=51) or the 
placebo control group (N=49). Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline 
and week 12, mixed-effects models were used to analyze the impact of the 
prebiotic on gut microbiota and inflammatory markers.
RESULTS: Both groups showed an increase in Bacteroidetes abundance over 12 
weeks, but the increase was smaller in the intervention group (β = -5.507; 95% 
CI: -11.390 to 0.375; P = 0.066). Unidentified Ruminococcaceae increased in the 
intervention group (β = 2.072; 95% CI: -0.130 to 4.274; P = 0.065), but declined 
in the control group. A significant increase in IL-10 levels was observed in the 
intervention group (β = 0.778; 95% CI: 0.132 to 1.425; P = 0.019), in contrast 
to a downward trend in the control group. Notably, baseline TNF-α levels 
appeared to modify the intervention's microbial effects. Specifically, for each 
1 pg/mL increase, the intervention was associated with increased Actinobacteria 
(β = 0.624; 95% CI: 0.100 to 1.148; Pinteraction = 0.020), Bifidobacteriaceae (β 
= 0.608; 95% CI: 0.114 to 1.103; Pinteraction = 0.017), and Bifidobacterium (β = 
0.608; 95% CI: 0.114 to 1.103; Pinteraction = 0.017). However, these 
associations did not remain statistically significant after false discovery rate 
adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: The prebiotic intervention effectively increased the abundance of 
beneficial bacteria, while simultaneously reducing inflammatory levels in 
individuals with colorectal adenoma.
TRIAL REGISTRATION AND ETHICS APPROVAL: The trial registration number of this 
study is ChiCTR2100046390. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Tianjin Nankai Hospital (No. NKYY_YXKT_IRB_2021_048_01).

The identification of effective T cell receptors (TCRs) with specific reactivity 
against tumor cells is critical for the efficacy of TCR-engineered T cell 
therapy. However, different approaches for screening effective TCRs remain to be 
explored. We developed an optimized approach to identify effective TCRs based on 
an organoid culture system with patient-derived tumor cells in the presence of 
oxaliplatin and autologous dendritic cells. By coculturing the immunogenic 
debris of patient tumor cells from the organoid, we successfully enriched 
tumor-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, enhanced the activation and proliferation 
of T cells, and could facilitate the identification of tumor-reactive CD8+ T 
cells from patients with MHC I-downregulated tumors. We further used autologous 
tumor organoids to verify that candidate tumor-specific TCRs can elicit 
patient-specific tumor recognition and killing when expressed in allogeneic T 
cells. Our organoid-based tumor-reactive T cell enrichment system and TCR 
screening validation platform provide an empirical strategy for the isolation of 
tumor-reactive T cells and can advance the study of TCR-engineered T cell 
therapy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent 
chemicals that contaminate air, water, soil, and food. Due to their widespread 
use, PFAS are detectable in most of the US population, raising concerns about 
potential health impacts, including a possible association with colorectal 
cancer (CRC). We conducted a scoping review of previously published studies to 
consolidate the current understanding of PFAS and its effect on CRC risk, 
identify knowledge gaps, and propose future directions for research.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for 
studies published through December 2024 that examined PFAS exposure in relation 
to CRC risk or progression. Data were independently extracted using a 
standardized protocol and structured according to a predefined Population, 
Exposure, Comparator, Outcome (PECO) framework. To evaluate internal validity, 
studies were categorized by evidence stream (in vitro, animal, and 
epidemiological) and assessed using established quality appraisal criteria.
RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were identified, including 5 reviews, 3 in vitro 
studies, 6 animal studies, and 12 epidemiological studies. In vitro research 
consistently demonstrates that PFAS exposure promotes CRC cell proliferation and 
migration, highlighting key mechanistic pathways. However, findings from animal 
and epidemiological studies are mixed, with some indicating increased intestinal 
tumorigenesis while others report null or protective effects. Notably, major 
studies were cross-sectional, retrospective, or ecological, emphasizing the need 
for high-quality longitudinal research to clarify PFAS's role in CRC risk and 
progression.
CONCLUSION: Evidence on the relationship between PFAS exposure and CRC risk 
remains limited and inconclusive. Large-scale, prospective epidemiological 
studies that incorporate biomarker-based exposure assessment, including 
pre-diagnostic PFAS levels, diverse populations, and rigorous study design are 
needed to clarify the role of PFAS in CRC development. Such research could 
provide the role of PFAS in CRC development and progression, guiding public 
health policies and support targeted interventions to reduce CRC risk.

Our study aims to systematically investigate the potential carcinogenic 
mechanisms of bisphenol A (BPA) in three gastrointestinal tumors: intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and esophageal cancer. By 
systematically integrating multi-omics databases, including transcriptomics and 
single-cell transcriptomics, we identified overlapping targets between 
BPA-associated molecules and tumor-related genes. Functional enrichment revealed 
that these targets converge on key oncogenic pathways, includingcellular 
metabolic reprogramming (particularly glycolysis), tumor microenvironment 
remodeling via cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation, and dysregulation 
of cell cycle progression. Molecular docking verified strong binding affinity 
between BPA and key targets. Survival analysis linked GAPDH and HSP90AA1 in ICC, 
CDKN1A, CEBPB, and EGR1 in CRC, and DCN and CXCL12 in esophageal cancer to poor 
survival rates, highlighting their potential as prognostic biomarkers. Our 
findings demonstrate that BPA promotes gastrointestinal carcinogenesisthrough 
disrupting energy metabolism, activating CAFs to remodel the tumor 
microenvironment, and enhancing cancer cell proliferation. This multi-level 
evidence advances the risk assessment of BPA and identifies potential targets 
for prevention and therapy of BPA-linked gastrointestinal cancers. Environmental 
Implication. In addition to well-documented role in promoting endocrine-related 
diseases, the mechanisms by which hazardous compound bisphenol A (BPA) 
contributes to other pathological conditions must not be overlooked. Through 
systematic integration of biological evidence chains, this study revealed BPA's 
triple carcinogenic mechanism involving interference with cell cycle 
checkpoints, remodeling of tumor microenvironment stroma, and disruption of 
epigenetic regulation, thereby providing a novel target system for preventing 
environmental toxicant-induced gastrointestinal tumors.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between cancer literacy (CL) and cancer 
screening behaviors, including screening intention and uptake.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted across three databases up to 
October 2024 (CRD42024500935). Studies were included if they (i) had an 
observational design, (ii) measured CL using validated or ad hoc tools, and 
(iii) quantified its association with cancer screening intention and/or uptake. 
Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Findings were narratively 
synthesized by cancer type for each outcome.
RESULTS: Six cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria: one focused on 
screening intention, four on screening uptake, and one on both outcomes. Data 
were available for breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate, and skin cancer. 
Study quality was heterogeneous, with most studies rated as fair quality and 
affected by methodological limitations, including reliance on self-reported 
data, imprecise outcome definitions and measurements, and heterogeneous target 
populations. While higher levels of CL were linked to increased screening 
intentions in both included studies, findings on screening uptake were 
inconsistent across and within cancer types, with significant associations more 
commonly observed in adjusted analyses. Although a few studies suggested that 
awareness of the importance of preventive measures may influence screening 
adherence, the overall results remained inconclusive across all cancer types.
CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests a positive association between higher CL and 
cancer screening intentions, although the evidence is limited. The role of CL in 
screening uptake remains uncertain, indicating that additional factors may 
influence adherence. Given the limited evidence, methodological variability, and 
study limitations, further research employing more robust and standardized 
approaches is essential to better understand the role of CL in cancer-related 
behaviors.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Improving CL may have a role in shaping cancer screening 
behaviors, particularly in promoting screening intention. More rigorous research 
is needed to clarify the role of CL in screening behaviors.

BACKGROUND: Resistance to Bevacizumab (Bev) remains a major obstacle in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. Gamma-synuclein (SNCG), overexpressed in 
tumor vasculature and cancer cells, is investigated here for its role in Bev 
resistance and therapeutic potential.
METHODS: Using isogenic CRC models with SNCG overexpression or knockout, we 
assessed SNCG's impact on Bev response in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic 
efficacy of combining Bev with an anti-SNCG monoclonal antibody (42#) was 
evaluated in Bev-resistant models. Mechanistic studies, including ELISA, Western 
blot, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and molecular docking, explored 
interactions between SNCG, VEGF, and VEGFR2.
RESULTS: SNCG overexpression reduced Bev sensitivity by impairing the inhibition 
of migration, invasion, and spheroid formation, whereas SNCG knockout enhanced 
therapeutic response. Molecular docking revealed that SNCG binds VEGFR2 at an 
allosteric site, forming a stable ternary complex (SNCG-VEGF-VEGFR2) with 
enhanced hydrogen bonding, which sustained VEGFR2 phosphorylation and 
angiogenesis. In vivo, SNCG-overexpressing tumors showed reduced responsiveness 
to Bev (42.8 % inhibition vs. 64.3 % in controls, p < 0.05), while 
SNCG-deficient tumors exhibited a 3.2-fold increase in sensitivity. Combining 
Bev with 42# synergistically suppressed tumor growth (0.70 ± 0.36 g vs. 
1.55 ± 0.41 g, p = 0.003), reduced metastatic burden (0.29 ± 0.23 g vs. 
0.97 ± 0.42 g, p = 0.006), and extended median survival (86.8 vs. 69.8 days, 
p = 0.033) in Bev-resistant models.
CONCLUSIONS: SNCG drives Bev resistance in CRC by forming a ternary complex with 
VEGF and VEGFR2, enhancing VEGFR2 signaling and angiogenesis. Dual targeting of 
VEGF and SNCG represents a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome Bev 
resistance, with the potential to improve outcomes in CRC patients.

OBJECTIVE: This phase III randomized trial compared two-week course of 
preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with conventional long-course CRT followed 
by total mesorectal excision (TME) in rectal cancer.
BACKGROUND: Two-week schedule of hypofractionated radiotherapy with concurrent 
capecitabine showed favorable tumor response and safety in a previous phase II 
study.
METHODS: This study enrolled 338 rectal cancer patients with cT3-4N0-2M0 to 
receive either standard long-course preoperative radiotherapy (50.4 Gy in 28 
fractions over 5-6 wk) or two-week course of radiation (33 Gy in 10 fractions 
over two weeks) with concurrent intravenous 5-fluorouracil or oral capecitabine. 
The primary endpoint was downstaging (ypT0-2N0M0) rate. TME was performed 6-10 
weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.
RESULTS: Of 338 patients, 167 received standard long-course CRT and 171 received 
two-week course of CRT. ypCR was achieved in 26 (15.6%) patients of the 
standard-course arm and in 25 (14.6%) patients of the two-week-course arm 
(P=0.807). Downstaging was achieved in 67 (40.1%) patients of the 
standard-course arm and in 62 (36.3%) patients of the two-week-course arm 
(P=0.465). Sphincter preservation (91.0% vs. 95.3%, P=0.116) and positive 
circumferential resection margin (9.0% vs. 14.6%, P=0.109) rates were not 
significantly different between the two arms. The two-week arm demonstrated 
significantly lower incidence of grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal toxicity 
than the standard arm (5.8% vs. 13.2%, P=0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: This phase III randomized controlled trial suggests that two-week 
course of preoperative CRT provides comparable tumor response as standard 
long-course CRT in rectal cancer, with potential advantages of shorter treatment 
duration and lower gastrointestinal toxicity.

Noninvasive tests for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in average-risk 
individuals continue to evolve, with the premise of increasing screening 
participation among eligible individuals. In addition to fecal immunochemical 
testing (FIT), which has become the noninvasive standard for which to improve 
sensitivity for detecting CRC and specificity for detecting the absence of CRC, 
new US Food and Drug Administration-approved tests include the detection of DNA 
in a next-generation multitarget stool DNA test, the detection of RNA in a 
multitarget stool RNA test, and blood tests that detect cell-free DNA for 
genomic alterations, fragmentations, and aberrant methylation, all of which have 
undergone large clinical trials for effectiveness. Each of these new tests 
improves upon the CRC sensitivity of FIT but not its specificity. Test 
sensitivity for CRC detection in persons <50 years of age is comparable to that 
in persons >50 years. Fecal tests with direct sampling of stool have improved 
sensitivity for advanced adenomas compared to FIT, but advanced adenoma 
sensitivity is regressed in blood tests compared to FIT. With about a third of 
the screening-eligible population not actively screened in the United States, 
the expansion of the screening-eligible population to include those >45 years of 
age, the disparity in some populations with lower-than-average screening rates, 
and the limited colonoscopy screening opportunities due to choice, schedule, 
availability, or pandemic interruption, these noninvasive tests may fill the gap 
and rectify CRC screening shortcomings and barriers that colonoscopy alone 
cannot fill.

ARID1A, a subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeler, is frequently mutated in 
cancer. Predicting how ARID1A loss impacts cancer therapy response is 
challenging because it influences many cellular pathways. G quadruplex (G4) 
binding ligands, such as pyridostatin, show anticancer effects, but the genetic 
determinants influencing the response to G4 ligands are not fully understood. 
Here, we show that ARID1A-deficient cells are selectively sensitive to 
pyridostatin compared to isogenic controls. This was apparent in ovarian and 
colorectal cancer cell line models, and in vivo studies suggest that G4 ligands 
hold promise for ARID1A-deficient cancers. While ARID1A modulates 
pyridostatin-induced transcriptional responses, we show that toxicity in 
ARID1A-deficient cells arises from the defective repair of topoisomerase-induced 
breaks. Notably, these cells fail to efficiently accumulate non-homologous end 
joining proteins on chromatin following pyridostatin exposure. These data 
uncover a role for ARID1A in the cellular response to G4 ligands, linking 
remodeling to G4 ligand-induced responses.

Cancer cells reprogram cellular energetics to drive tumorigenesis and escape 
immunosurveillance. Nevertheless, how this is molecularly connected remains 
largely undefined. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) serves as a 
critical metabolic node in cancer cells that provides the basis for protein 
glycosylation. Herein, we show that HBP flux inhibition by knocking out its 
rate-limiting enzyme GFAT1 suppressed tumor growth and stimulated cytotoxic CD8+ 
T lymphocyte infiltration in a colorectal cancer model. GFAT1 induced the 
expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1 at the translational level by 
bypassing signal peptide-mediated translation elongation arrest. Proteomic and 
glycoproteomic screening indicated that GFAT1 facilitated the N-linked 
glycosylation and protein expression of integrin α2/α3 subunits, leading to FAK 
activation and elongation factor eEF1A2 upregulation. Pharmacological inhibition 
of HBP noticeably enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in vivo. 
Together, these findings unravel how immune checkpoint proteins are manipulated 
by metabolic dysregulation, which can be exploited as metabolic vulnerability 
for improving immunotherapies.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival 
(CSS) of right-sided colon cancer patients undergoing CME versus D2 surgery 
after 5 years of follow-up, and to assess the heterogeneity of treatment 
effectiveness of CME between different subgroups.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The 3-year result of the Radical Extent of 
lymphadenectomy of Laparoscopic Right Colectomy for colon cancer (RELARC) trial 
showed that standard D2 dissection should be performed in right-sided colon 
cancer patients. In patients with lymph node metastasis, complete mesocolic 
excision (CME) showed potentially favorable results.
METHODS: The parallel, open label, randomized controlled trial was conducted 
between January, 2016 to December, 2019 in 17 hospitals in China. Of a total of 
1072 eligible patients enrolled, 995 patients were included in the modified 
intention-to-treat analysis. In the present study, the primary outcome was 
5-year OS and the secondary outcome was 5-year CSS. The trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02619942).
RESULTS: 995 patients were included in the final analysis. There was no 
significant difference between the 5-year OS (HR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.51-1.07, 
P=0.105) or CSS (HR: 0.72, 95%CI: 0.49-1.06, P=0.091) in the CME and D2 groups. 
CME appears to improve 5-year outcomes in patients with stage III disease (OS: 
HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.93, P=0.023; CSS: HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.37-0.94, 
P=0.028), particularly in those with pN2 (OS: HR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.11-0.57, 
P=0.001; CSS: HR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.11-0.57, P=0.001), where a statistically 
significant interaction was identified. Patients with lymphovascular invasion 
also demonstrated favorable outcomes with CME with significant interaction 
effect (OS: HR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.17-0.70; interaction P=0.009; CSS: HR: 0.32, 95% 
CI: 0.15-0.67, interaction P=0.008).
CONCLUSION: The standard D2 dissection provides oncologic outcomes comparable to 
CME on the 5-year follow-up. However, CME seems to improve 5-year outcomes in 
patients with stage III, particularly those with pN2 status, and may confer 
benefit in patients with LVI.

Accurate prognosis prediction in colorectal cancer (CRC) is essential for 
personalized treatment. Soluble mediators are promising predictive biomarkers 
for evaluating outcomes. We sourced transcriptome data of CRC (COAD+READ) from 
TCGA and GEO. Soluble mediator-related genes (SMRGs) were identified via 
GeneCards. Through univariate Cox and Lasso regression analyses, 
prognosis-related feature genes were determined. A prognostic model was created 
using multivariate Cox regression, categorizing patients into high-risk (HR) and 
low-risk (LR) groups based on the median riskscore. KEGG pathway enrichment 
analysis and GSEA were undertaken on groups. ssGSEA assessed immune cell scores, 
while ESTIMATE analysis evaluated stromal and immune cell scores along with 
tumor purity. The CellMiner database identified potential drugs for HR patients. 
Pearson correlation analysis revealed the relationship between mismatch repair 
(MMR) genes and model genes. We identified 10 SMRGs. Pearson correlation 
analysis indicated positive correlations among these genes. GO analysis showed 
that most feature genes were linked to binding functions. KEGG analysis revealed 
that the HR group was enriched in pathways like Basal cell carcinoma and 
Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. The ssGSEA indicated higher immune cell scores 
in the LR group, alongside lower stromal scores. LR group also exhibited a lower 
TIDE score and higher immunophenoscore. Drug sensitivity analysis suggested 
PF-4708671, PI-103, and XAV939 as potential treatments for HR patients. There 
was significant correlation between model gene and MMR genes. The CRC prognostic 
model based on SMRGs effectively predicts patient prognosis and guides treatment 
strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer are significant global health challenges 
that highlight the need for the development of new therapeutics. Targeting 
biological mechanisms involved in both AD and cancer could be an effective 
treatment strategy for developing novel inhibitors. In this study, we 
investigated the effect of a newly synthesized boron containing curcumin-like 
compound as a potential acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor along with its 
cytotoxic effects on breast and colorectal cancer cell lines. Compound A 
exhibited a potent AChE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 22.89 ± 2.32 nM), 
demonstrating that it was more effective than the known inhibitors donepezil 
(IC50 = 28.32 ± 3.27 nM) and tacrine. Compound A showed a moderate cytotoxic 
activity on MCF-7 and BT20 cells with the IC50 values 40.70 ± 2.31 μM and 
41.71 ± 4.51 μM, respectively. Throughout molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, 
the RMSD value of the protein was calculated as 1.56 ± 0.20 Å and 1.65 ± 0.19 Å 
for the complexes of compound A and curcumin, respectively. The interactions 
with specific amino acid residues such as Tyr124, Tyr337, and Trp86 for AChE, 
and Trp82, His438, and Tyr332 for BChE were obtained. Additionally, MM/GBSA 
calculations demonstrated that Compound A had the highest binding free energies 
(-88.89 ± 8.34 kcal/mol for AChE and -73.25 ± 8.83 kcal/mol for BChE) compared 
to curcumin (-67.87 ± 5.48 kcal/mol for AChE and -51.68 ± 5.28 kcal/mol for 
BChE) and tacrine (-56.67 ± 2.22 kcal/mol for BChE) were calculated. Overall, 
these findings suggest that Compound A is a promising agent with its potent AChE 
inhibitory activity and anticancer potential, making it a valuable candidate for 
further research in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer (RC) remains a significant global health concern, with 
increasing incidence rates and associated mortality. Early detection of 
metastases plays a crucial role in the effective management of rectal cancer and 
predicting patient outcomes. Imaging modalities are vital in diagnosing and 
evaluating the extent of metastases. The integration of novel hybrid positron 
emission tomography utilizing fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) fused with magnetic 
resonance (PET/MR) has emerged as an innovative diagnostic tool. By combining 
both technologies' strengths, PET/MR imaging provides precise metabolic 
information from PET alongside detailed anatomical data from MR. This 
prospective study aimed to assess the clinical utility of PET/MR imaging with 
the 18F-FDG tracer compared to standard imaging modalities for detecting the 
extent of RC.
METHODS: We enrolled 42 patients who underwent both standard imaging (CT and/or 
MRI) and whole-body PET/MR with 18F-FDG before preoperative therapy.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that PET/MR with 18F-FDG provides superior 
detection of lymph nodes and tumor deposits in the mesorectum, with the highest 
diagnostic accuracy for tumor length measurement (area under the ROC curve 
(AUC) = 0.730; p < 0.05) and a combined model of SUVmax and CEA (AUC = 0.921; 
p < 0.001). Furthermore, PET/MR changed the clinical stage in 64% of patients 
and altered clinical management in 26% of cases.  CONCLUSIONS: The presented 
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this advanced imaging technique and 
its potential to enhance treatment planning. By providing more accurate staging 
information, this method could significantly improve diagnosis, treatment 
customization, and overall outcomes for patients with rectal cancer, 
particularly in cases where lymph node involvement and tumor deposits impact 
therapeutic decisions.

Surrey, Guildford, UK.

BACKGROUND: Men face numerous challenges when deciding whether to engage in 
help-seeking for abnormal lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), with help-seeking 
behaviour a multi-step process.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores the barriers and facilitators to 
help-seeking behaviour in adult men for abnormal LUTS.
METHODS: Eight databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCOhost, 
SCOPUS, OVID, ProQuest and PsychINFO) were searched between January 2023 and 
March 2024. Studies were required to meet the inclusion criteria informed by 
PRISMA guidelines. Qualitative and mixed-method studies were included in the 
systematic review.
RESULTS: (N) = 17 full-text articles were included in the review, totalling 
(n) = 704 participants. The systematic review uncovered four key themes: men 
have poor relationships with the healthcare system, some minority groups have 
dysfunctional cultural beliefs and attitudes towards help-seeking behaviour, 
traditional gender views and perceptions of masculinity discourage help-seeking 
behaviour and men have intrapersonal and external barriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Men face considerable challenges when deciding to engage in 
help-seeking for abnormal LUTS, with men generally lacking awareness and 
knowledge of what they should do when experiencing symptoms. This is more 
profound in men from minority groups. This review may have had a language bias 
as non-English studies were excluded. This review may be essential to inform the 
development of interventions to facilitate help-seeking behaviour for abnormal 
LUTS in men, specifically men from minority populations.

In this study, a multifunctional fluorescent sensing platform was constructed 
via stepwise functional modification. The platform is based on a cobalt 
(II)-containing metal-organic framework (MOF) and was successively modified with 
donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASA), a natural product-derived compound 1, 
and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), yielding the composite material 
1-DASA-APTMS@CP1. This material was further employed for the loading and 
selective detection of the anticancer model drug 5-FU (1-DASA-ATPMS@CP1@5-Fu). 
Fluorescence sensing experiments revealed that 1-DASA-APTMS@CP1 exhibited 
excellent selectivity and sensitivity toward Fe3+ and 5-FU among a series of 
metal ions and antibiotics. The calculated Stern-Volmer quenching constants 
(Ksv) were 1.38 × 104 M-1 for Fe3+ and 1.77 × 104 M-1 for 5-FU, with 
corresponding detection limits of 6.04 and 4.71 μM, respectively. Furthermore, 
in vitro experiments using human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells confirmed the 
therapeutic potential of the platform. The 1-DASA-APTMS@CP1@5-Fu system 
significantly enhanced apoptosis induction, as demonstrated by CCK-8 assays, 
qPCR, and western blot analysis, which showed upregulation of the proapoptotic 
protein Bax. This study provides a novel strategy and experimental basis for 
colorectal cancer targeted drug delivery and fluorescence-guided cancer 
theranostics.

INTRODUCTION: In the United Kingdom, community pharmacists (CPs) are 
increasingly being used to provide supplemental care for patients with specific 
conditions while the NHS is under pressure from declining GP numbers alongside a 
rising demand for services. CPs are ideally placed to contribute to early 
diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) through extended services, especially 
amongst deprived areas where access is higher across all deprivation deciles in 
urban areas. However, they need to be embedded within integrated pathways with 
clear lines of communication and co-operation between CPs and other healthcare 
professionals. There is not yet a clear understanding of the challenges and 
barriers to this integration, or the best way forward to expand CP services to 
include earlier CRC diagnosis. The present study aimed to co-produce a set of 
practice guidelines and research recommendations about how community pharmacy 
can facilitate early CRC diagnosis.
METHODS: We ran a series of three co-production workshops across two sites (six 
total) in London and Newcastle (2023-2024). Nominal Group Technique was chosen 
to structure each co-production session and provided the basis of our workshop 
guide. Workshops were audio recorded and transcribed for qualitative analysis 
using both a framework approach and an inductive content analysis, which is the 
focus of this paper.
RESULTS: The salient issues CP staff face include assessing individual risk, 
incorporating additional services into existing workloads and financial 
constraints, advertising these services effectively, better use of physical 
space to allay CP users' privacy concerns, and finding ways better with other 
healthcare providers.
CONCLUSION: Expanding CP services to include screening efforts for CRC is 
achievable in the short term through practical actions. Key recommendations 
include addressing privacy concerns for pharmacy customers when discussing CRC 
symptoms, better utilising and expanding digital communication tools to 
facilitate closer working relationships between CPs and other healthcare 
professionals, and providing adequate incentives, screening and support 
materials to CPs, including FIT kits.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: PPIE input was central throughout all stages of 
this study including study conception via our public co-applicant (L. B.), 
methodology and study conduct. We held meetings of both a patient advisory group 
and a steering committee of academics and PPIE representatives throughout the 
project. Our steering committee held two meetings, once at the onset of study 
development, and again prior to our final dissemination workshop. This consisted 
of nine people, one of whom was a patient representative. Our patient advisory 
group met twice during our project, comprised of ten people, five of whom were 
patient representatives along with five members of the research team. This group 
met to review our process after completion of the first workshop at each site, 
and then again after completion of all workshops to plan our final consolidation 
meeting. Each workshop was also facilitated by our public co-applicant and, in 
some cases, other patient representatives, who met regularly with other 
facilitators during the organising and running of each workshop. Members of our 
PPIE group contributed to the paper write up as co-authors and led on the 
creation of study dissemination materials, including a video podcast and 
website.

BACKGROUND: Management of cutaneous metastases in colorectal cancer is crucial 
because it can significantly impact patient survival.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the global prognosis of skin metastases among patients 
treated for colorectal cancer.
METHODS: A systematic review of the PubMed database only was conducted for 
English articles or reports published between 1 January 1990 and 1 November 
2023. Reports concerning clinical outcomes of patients with cutaneous metastases 
of colorectal cancer and systematic reviews of the literature were included. 
Study characteristics and results of eligible studies were independently 
extracted by two reviewers (A.C.E., E.T.). The histology, locations, and 
prognosis of patients with skin metastases of colorectal cancer were analyzed.
RESULTS: Data were obtained from almost 100 articles, most of which were case 
reports. Follow-up data were available for 62 patients. The most common site was 
rectal adenocarcinoma (58%), followed by right and left colon adenocarcinomas. A 
significant number of these metastases were metachronous (61%). The median time 
to death was 5.5 months [interquartile range, 3-10], ranging from 1 to 
60 months. Treatment of cutaneous metastases, even if associated with other 
metastases, significantly improved overall survival (p < 0.001; hazard ratio, 
0.15), regardless of the proposed treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: We carried out the most extensive review of the literature 
concerning cutaneous metastases of colorectal cancer to date. The review showed 
that cutaneous metastases are associated with a poor prognosis and short 
survival time. We suggest treating patients with cutaneous metastasis as if such 
metastasis were a surrogate marker or sentinel for aggressive metastatic 
disease.

Risk of Distant Metastasis After Total Neoadjuvant Therapy: Local Regrowth 
Versus Surgery After Total Neoadjuvant Therapy With Pathologic Near-Complete 
Response in Rectal Cancer.

Karahan S(1), Erkaya M, Oruc M, Steele S, Rosen D, Sommavilla J, Liska D, Gorgun 
E.

Author information:

Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.

BACKGROUND: In rectal cancer patients with a clinical complete response managed 
nonoperatively, local regrowth occurs in up to 35%. Although prior studies 
suggest a higher metastatic risk after regrowth, most data are derived from 
conventional chemoradiotherapy cohorts. The risk in a total neoadjuvant therapy 
setting remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether local regrowth after clinical complete response in 
patients treated with total neoadjuvant therapy increases the risk of distant 
metastasis, and to evaluate if the risk could be reduced by upfront surgery 
performed after total neoadjuvant therapy.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Single tertiary care center.
PATIENTS: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with total 
neoadjuvant therapy between 2018 and 2024 who achieved a clinical complete 
response, were managed nonoperatively, developed local regrowth, and 
subsequently underwent salvage total mesorectal excision, compared with those 
who underwent upfront total mesorectal excision after total neoadjuvant therapy, 
with final pathology demonstrating a near-complete response.
INTERVENTION: Total neoadjuvant therapy followed by either watch & wait and 
salvage total mesorectal excision or upfront total mesorectal excision.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was distant metastasis. Secondary 
outcomes included distant metastasis-free survival and independent predictors of 
distant spread.
RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included (median age: 58 years [IQR, 51-67]; 
58% male): 32 with local regrowth managed by salvage total mesorectal excision 
and 42 with upfront total mesorectal excision. The distant metastasis-free 
survival was comparable between groups, and local regrowth was not independently 
associated with distant metastasis (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.25-4.00). ypT3-4 stage 
was independently associated with increased risk of distant metastasis (OR, 5.8; 
95% CI, 1.3-25.3), while complete mesorectal excision was protective (OR, 0.08; 
95% CI, 0.01-0.59).
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design, small sample size, and limited follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Patients treated with total neoadjuvant therapy who developed local 
regrowth and underwent salvage total mesorectal excision achieved distant 
metastasis rates comparable to those who underwent upfront surgery after total 
neoadjuvant therapy and demonstrated a pathologic near-complete response. 
High-quality salvage surgery and close surveillance are essential for optimizing 
oncologic outcomes. See Video Abstract.

OBJECTIVE: The gut microbiome and bile acids (BAs) likely influence colorectal 
cancer (CRC) development and disparities. We conducted a nested case-control 
study of the associations of the colon tissue microbiome and circulating BAs 
with colorectal adenoma prevalence in the previously conducted multi-center 
Colorectal Neoplasia Screening with Colonoscopy in Average-Risk Women Regional 
Navy/Army Medical Centers study (CONCeRN).
METHODS: We individually matched 143 women with adenoma to 279 without adenoma. 
Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we assessed alpha and beta diversity, taxonomic 
abundance, and co-abundance groups (CAGs). Fasting serum was analyzed for 13 
primary and secondary BAs.
RESULTS: The presence of oral-originating Porphyromonas was positively 
associated with adenomas (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 2.50 [1.18, 5.30]; p = 0.02). Race and study center explained 
statistically significant percentages of variation in the beta diversity 
matrices. BAs were generally positively associated with adenomas, though these 
results were not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION: Overall, our findings suggest the colon tissue microbiome may differ 
by race and geography, and that certain oral-originating bacteria may be 
positively associated with adenomas.

Following the publication of the above article, an interested reader drew the 
authors' attention to the fact that the CTK18 panel in Fig. 2E on p. 1917, 
showing the results of RT‑PCR analysis of cytokeratin 18 from patient no. 88, 
appeared to be very similar to the CTK18 panel in Fig. 2F (showing the results 
from patient no. 93). After having re‑examined their original data, which were 
also presented to the Editorial Office, and considering that the observed 
experiment is an end-point RT-PCR performed more than ten years ago, the authors 
cannot definitively rule out the possibility that Fig. 2E was inadvertently 
misassembled. Therefore, given the high similarity of the two images, it was 
decided to publish a revised version of Fig. 2, which now shows data from a 
different replicate of the experiment for the CTK18 panel in Fig. 2E, shown on 
the next page. Note that this revision did not affect the overall conclusions 
reported in the study. The authors are grateful to the Editor of International 
Journal of Oncology for allowing them this opportunity to publish a Corrigendum, 
and all the authors agree with its publication. Furthermore, the authors

BACKGROUND: Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are among the most common craniofacial birth 
defects and have been investigated for possible associations with increased 
cancer risk in affected individuals and their families.
METHOD: This narrative review synthesizes current evidence from epidemiological, 
familial, and genetic studies.
RESULTS: Population-based and registry analyses have reported elevated risks of 
breast, brain, lung, oral, colorectal, and hematologic cancers, while 
meta-analyses highlight inconsistent findings and frequent null associations. 
Familial clustering studies provide stronger support, with excess colorectal and 
gastric cancers observed in AXIN2- and CDH1-positive pedigrees and an increased 
prevalence of cancer among relatives of non-syndromic cleft lip and palate 
patients. At the genetic level, variants in AXIN2, CDH1, FOXE1, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, 
and E2F1 have been implicated in both craniofacial development and 
tumorigenesis. Evidence also points to the modifying role of environmental 
exposures, particularly maternal smoking, which may interact with susceptibility 
variants to amplify risk. Current research is limited by small sample sizes, 
subtype heterogeneity, and underrepresentation of late-onset cancers. Larger, 
subtype-specific studies integrating genomic and environmental data are needed 
to clarify risk pathways and guide the development of targeted screening 
strategies for individuals with OFCs and their families.

Natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for 
treating colorectal cancer because of their innate ability to recognize and 
eliminate tumor cells without prior sensitization. In this review, NK cell-based 
immunotherapeutic approaches, including cytokine therapy, immune checkpoint 
inhibition, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and adoptive cell 
transfer, are comprehensively examined, and their respective clinical potential 
and limitations are highlighted. We discuss critical challenges in NK cell 
expansion, genetic engineering (particularly chimeric antigen receptor-NK 
development), and tumor microenvironment-mediated immunosuppression. 
Furthermore, we explore innovative strategies such as combination therapies, 
nanotechnology-enhanced delivery, and personalized medicine approaches that aim 
to overcome the current barriers. The review concludes with future directions 
emphasizing the need for standardized manufacturing protocols, new strategies to 
improve NK cell persistence, and clinical validation of emerging technologies, 
positioning NK cell immunotherapy as a transformative modality for colorectal 
cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health burden. B cell 
CLL/lymphoma 10 (BCL10), a key component of the caspase recruitment domain 
protein-BCL10-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma paracaspase complexes, 
is upregulated in CRC and associated with poor patient prognosis, suggesting its 
potential role in CRC development and progression. Cuproptosis, a novel form of 
programmed cell death, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for 
cancer.
AIM: To explore the role of BCL10 in regulating the sensitivity of CRC cells to 
cuproptosis.
METHODS: A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted using CRC 
cell lines and CRC mouse models to evaluate the effects of BCL10 on CRC cell 
proliferation, migration, invasion, and sensitivity to copper-induced cell 
death. Mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the underlying molecular 
pathways.
RESULTS: BCL10 promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while 
its knockdown had the opposite effects. BCL10 also influenced the sensitivity of 
CRC cells to cuproptosis, with BCL10 overexpression enhancing resistance and its 
knockdown increasing sensitivity. The mechanism involved BCL10 modulating the 
expression of DLAT, a key protein in the copper-induced cell death pathway, 
through activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: BCL10 promotes CRC growth and regulates the sensitivity of CRC cells 
to cuproptosis by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway and modulating DLAT 
expression. These findings provide a molecular basis for developing 
BCL10-targeted therapies for CRC.

BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels are associated with 
increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly in patients with 
systemic inflammation or chronic conditions.
AIM: To evaluate serum Hcy levels as a predictive marker of lesion risk and CRC 
to prioritize patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 301 fecal occult blood 
test-positive patients at San Agustín University Hospital in Asturias, Spain. 
Plasma Hcy levels were measured prior to the colonoscopy and classified into 
three thresholds: ≤ 12, 12-15, and > 15 μmol/L. Colonoscopy and histopathology 
determined the presence of low-risk, high-risk polyps or adenocarcinoma. 
Predictive performance of serum Hcy to detect lesions was assessed using 
logistic regression and diagnostic accuracy measures, including models adjusted 
for age and sex.
RESULTS: Median Hcy levels rose progressively with lesion severity, reaching 
15.3 μmol/L in adenocarcinoma (P < 0.001). Higher levels were also observed in 
men and individuals aged 65 or older. A threshold above 15 μmol/L showed good 
sensitivity (76.6%) and positive predictive value (87.2%) for detecting 
adenocarcinoma. When combined with age and sex, predictive accuracy improved 
(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.706). Based on these 
findings, we propose a three-tier triage system: Green (≤ 12 μmol/L in both 
sexes, colonoscopy within three months), Yellow (> 12-15 μmol/L in men, 
intervention within one month and red (≥ 15 in either sex or > 12 μmol/L in 
women, immediate colonoscopy).
CONCLUSION: Serum Hcy is a clinically useful biomarker for identifying high-risk 
colorectal lesions and cancer, particularly when interpreted in combination with 
age and sex. This composite model improves predictive accuracy and enables a 
structured three-tiered triage system that supports faster colonoscopy 
scheduling for at-risk groups. The traffic light approach offers a low cost, 
scalable strategy to reduce delays and optimize resource use in CRC screening, 
especially in public health systems with limited endoscopic capacity.

Ulcerative colitis represents an inflammatory bowel disease with multiple 
contributing factors, marked by persistent inflammation of the colonic mucosa, 
which can lead to a reduced life expectancy and an elevated likelihood of 
requiring colectomy as well as developing colorectal cancer. Despite impacting 
roughly 5 million individuals worldwide, the intricate mechanisms underlying 
ulcerative colitis are still inadequately defined, hindering the development of 
effective treatments. Extra-intestinal complications, including enteropathic 
arthritis, are also addressed in the context of disease burden and management. 
This review explores the multifaceted pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, 
emphasizing critical factors such as abnormalities in the epithelial barrier, 
irregular immune responses, the release of inflammatory mediators, and 
alterations in gut microbiota composition. We also underscore recent 
advancements in diagnostic biomarkers that improve the accuracy of disease 
detection and monitoring. Conventional medicinal strategies are reviewed 
alongside the emergence of biological therapies, notably those that target tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins, and integrins, which have significantly 
altered management approaches. Established therapies (eg, 5-aminosalicylic acid, 
corticosteroids) and emerging agents (eg, JAK inhibitors, S1P modulators) are 
clearly delineated. Combination strategies-such as dual biologic regimens or JAK 
inhibitors combined with anti-integrin agents-are also discussed in dedicated 
subsections. We discuss novel therapies that utilize small molecule targeting, 
particularly those that inhibit Janus kinase (JAK) and modulate 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, presenting promising avenues for 
treatment. Additionally, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is evaluated as 
a therapeutic option, as it shows promise in restoring microbial balance. 
Collectively, these advances underscore the pivotal roles of immune 
dysregulation, biologic therapies, and microbiota modulation in reshaping 
precision management of ulcerative colitis. This synthesis of current knowledge 
underscores the necessity for continued research to refine therapeutic 
strategies and improve patient outcomes in ulcerative colitis.

The SLC25A32 gene plays a pivotal regulatory role in one-carbon metabolism and 
redox balance by functioning as a transporter for tetrahydrofolate and flavin 
adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The probable contribution of SLC25A32 toward 
facilitating the proliferation of cancerous cells remains inadequately explored. 
This pilot study aims to survey the expression of SLC25A32 in non-metastatic 
colorectal tissues and its potential association with clinicopathological 
characteristics. Fresh tissue samples were collected from 30 colorectal cancer 
patients and their adjacent normal tissues. Total RNA was extracted, and cDNA 
was synthesized for qRT-PCR. In silico analysis was also performed to further 
investigate the functional significance of SLC25A32 in colorectal cancer by 
examining its expression in normal tissues, identifying protein interactions, 
and searching for pathogenic mutations. Our results revealed a significant 
up-regulation of SLC25A32 expression in tumorous tissues compared to 
non-tumorous tissues. The elevated expression of SLC25A32 was associated with 
tumor anatomic site and size. In silico analysis revealed that higher levels of 
SLC25A32 expression were correlated with reduced overall survival rates. 
Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that this gene remarkably enriched in 
the process of Folate metabolism. The involvement of SLC25A32 in tumorigenesis 
may be due to its regulation of mitochondrial folate and FAD metabolism, which 
have been linked to cancer progression. Changes in SLC25A32 expression or 
function may contribute to cancer development, making it a potential therapeutic 
target for cancer treatment.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC? China has the world's largest population of 
individuals who are overweight or obese, contributing to the growing burden of 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening is an effective strategy for reducing CRC 
mortality and incidence.
WHAT IS ADDED BY THIS REPORT? Using a simulation model, we found that CRC 
screening reduces incidence and mortality across all body mass index groups 
(normal, overweight, and obese) in China, with greater quality-adjusted 
life-year gains and 6%-14% higher colonoscopy efficiency in individuals who are 
overweight or obese. Screening proved to be more cost-effective for these 
groups, despite high lifetime healthcare expenditures.
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE? CRC screening in China can 
prioritize populations with excess weight and incorporate weight management to 
improve health outcomes and control long-term healthcare costs.
